LiquidRescale Library Examples
==============================

The examples directory contains two C++ programs,
liquidrescale and liquidrescale-basic. The first one
is a full-featured command-line application, while the
second one is just a minimalistic version of the first.

These programs are meant to be used as reference code,
and to integrate the documentation, and they are fully
commented. The provided Makefile is also meant to
demonstrate the required compilation options, and it is
commented as well.

In order to compile the two programs, you will need the
pngwriter library to be properly installed on your system.
If your distribution doesn't include it, you can download
it from:

http://pngwriter.sourceforge.net/

Once compiled, you can see the command line options by
issuing:

./liquidrescale --help

or

./liquidrescale-basic --help
