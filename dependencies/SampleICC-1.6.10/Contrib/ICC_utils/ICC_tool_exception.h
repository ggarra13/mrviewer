  File:       ICC_tool_exception.h

  Contains:   Part of SampleICCToolUtils library:
  Provide for the basics of an exception model of use for icc*
  tools (as opposed to the return values used within SampleICC
  itself).  Not so much a pedagogical tool as a difference in 
  style between library implementor and tool implementor.

  Version:    V1
