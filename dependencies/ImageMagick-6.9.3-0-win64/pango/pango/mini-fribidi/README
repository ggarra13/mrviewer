This directory holds a stripped down version of GNU FriBidi library. The
fribidi version that fribidi.patch is against is 0.10.7 release.  The files
fribidi_config.h and Makefile.am are specifically written for Pango integration.

Like Pango, FriBidi is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License - see the file COPYING in the toplevel directory of the Pango
distribution.

The fribidi_tab_char_type_2.i table has been updated to correspond to
Unicode 5.1.0.

Please try not to make any changes to files duplicated in this directory.
The aim has been to only remove lines from those files, not add new ones.
Most of desired features can be implemented by preprocessor tricks in
fribidi_config.h.

This version of FriBidi is modified to support UTF-8 directly.  Search for
utf8 in the code to see where changes have gone.  It also has been modified to
short-circuit on unidirectional text.  Search for unidirectional to find that
part.
