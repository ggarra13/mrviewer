Version 0.4:

* New features:
  * Support for image types (color models):
    GREY, GREYA, RGB, RGBA, CMY, CMYK, CMYKA
    and custom
  * Additional builtin energy functions based on
    luma instead of brightness
  * Support for custom energy functions
  * Functions to read out the energy map
  * Cancel function to interrupt computations
  * Additional methods for bias and rigidity masks
  * Use a single progress instead of several
    ones when the update is performed in steps
  * Can handle input buffers non-destructively

* Performace related:
  * Faster rescaling thanks to optimisations in
    the code
  * Spare memory when not using features (e.g. the
    bias)

* Configuration
  * The default installation directory is now /usr
    instead of /usr/local
  * Compiling under MinGW now correctly produces a
    DLL with the default settings
  * Now it also compiles under MS Visual C++
  * All public macro names start with LQR_* (old
    versions are still available but can be disabled
    at configure time)

Version 0.3:

* New features:
  * Enlargement is not limited to 200% any more
    (it is automatically performed in steps)
  * Added readout functions for the internal
    visibility map

Version 0.2:

* New fetures:
  * Support for 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit
    per channel images
  * Rigidity masks
  * Left-right/top-bottom balance

* Performace related:
  * Improved attached visibility maps
    management (lower memory requirements)
  * All internal buffers turned from
    double to float, improving both speed
    and memory requirements

* Documentation:
  * Reviewed manual and completed refence
  * Added man pages
