LiquidRescale Library Manual
============================

The library manual is provided in docbook format.

Stylesheets and a makefile are also provided to get html versions and
manual pages.

*) Issuing `make' or `make html' will produce the manual in html format,
   with the file `liblqr_manual.html' pointing to the manual index.

*) Issuing `make onepage' will produce the manual in html formal in a single
   page, under the name `liblqr_manual_onepage.html'.

*) Issuing `make man' will produce the man pages in the directory `man3/'.

However, these assume that `xsltproc' is installed in your system and that
your docbook specifications are located at:

 html:    /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/nwalsh/html/chunk.xsl
 onepage: /usr/share/sgml/docbook/stylesheet/xsl/nwalsh/html/docbook.xsl
 man:     /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/nwalsh/manpages/docbook.xsl

If this is not the case, edit the `lqr_style.xsl', `lqr_style_onepage.xsl'
and `lqr_style_man.xsl' files accordingly.
