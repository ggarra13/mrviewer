README.lib
----------

This directory is used as a destination for the libraries fltk
compiles. "make install" will copy them to /usr/local/lib by default.

Fltk will compile a number of libraries, the multiple libraries are
designed to avoid having programs depend on libraries they are not
acutally using. For instance if the OpenGL functions were put into the
main fltk library you would be forced to link OpenGL even if your
program is not using it. This is a design problem with present-day
implementations of shared libraries on both Unix and Windows.

The libraries are:

    fltk2        - the core of fltk2, most programs only need this
    fltk2_images - functions that use png, jpeg, other image libraries
    fltk2_gl     - Fl_Gl_Window and functions that use OpenGL
    fltk2_glut   - glut emulation functions
    fltk2_forms  - forms emulation functions

Under UNIX you can compile either shared or static libraries. Static
libraries are the default and have names like libfltk2.a. Shared
libraries have (on most Unix systems) names like libfltk2.so.2.  To
enable shared libraries run "./configure --enable-shared".

Under Microsoft Visual C++ a successful build of all projects and
configurations will contain debug (fltk2d.lib and fltk2dlld.lib) and
release (fltk2.lib fltk2dll.lib) libraries for you to link to.  Both are
built using the multi-threaded settings.  The DLL files (fltk2dll.dll
and fltk2dlld.dll) required for a complete DLL-based binary distribution
are located in the "visualc" directory. WAS: is this correct? What
about when you use GCC or BC++?
