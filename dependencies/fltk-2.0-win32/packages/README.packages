Each of the subdirectories provide installation building scripts for
various operating systems.  These are used to produce the standard
binary distributions provided on the FLTK web site.

To build a distribution for your OS simply run the makedist.sh shell
script for your operating system:

    cd <operating-system>
    sh makedist.sh

For Microsoft Windows we are using the InstallShield software.
Unfortunately it is nearly impossible to distribute the InstallShield
"source" files...

If you'd like to contribute a binary distribution for your operating
system, send email to "webmaster@fltk.org".  If you have additions or
fixes to these scripts and distribution files, please send them via
the following page:
