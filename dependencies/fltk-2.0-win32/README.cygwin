This file explains how to build the FLTK library and demonstration programs
under Windows using the free Cygwin tools.  For this release, you must use the
build script or configure script to generate your makefiles.

Normal FLTK programs that do not use any Cygwin DLL functionality use only
the Mingw32 components of Cygwin.  Therefore, you are not obligated to pay
Cygnus (RedHat?) a license for using the Cygwin DLL if you create commercial
sofware using the Cygwin tools (if the software does not use the Cygwin DLL).
To be certain, run

   cygcheck <program.exe>

where "<program.exe>" is the name of your program.  Make sure that you don't
see anything like "cygwin1.dll" anywhere in the output and you are fine.  If
you need advanced Unix functionality in your commercial Windows NT program,
please consider licensing the Cygwin DLL from Cygnus (www.cygnus.com).


To compile FLTK using Cygwin, you will need to:

1a. Install the Cywin tools (of course).

1b. Update the Cygwin Tools with a recent development snapshot.

2.  Create a C:\TMP directory.

3.  Create a C:\BIN directory and copy SH.EXE from the Cygwin binary
    directory to it.  (Use Find Files or Folders to find SH.EXE if
    necessary.)

4.  Open a BASH shell prompt and switch to the toplevel FLTK directory and
    build the toolkit:

       make

5.  Optionally, you may build the toolkit and install its libraries and
    headers somewhere:

       ./configure --prefix=<installdir>
       make
       make install

    where "<installdir>" is the directory into which you wish to install the
    FLTK headers and libraries.

Please note that while the Cygwin tools work under Windows 95/98, they work
_much_ better and faster under Windows NT.  If you have a choice, develop
on an NT machine.

If you have problems compiling FLTK under Windows and you have followed these
instructions, please send a bug report to the developers via http://www.fltk.org/str.php.
