Besides the IccProfLib library the release includes four command-line
utilities that demonstrate how one might use the libraries to write,
read and apply ICC profiles.

BUILDING SampleICC
------------------

Mac OS X users, see README.OSX for build details.

As one might expect, on GNU/Linux or other UNIX-like systems, a simple
        ./configure
        make
        make install

will configure, compile and install the IccProfLib headers and the
SampleICC build products.  See the INSTALL file for more details or try 
       ./configure --help

All include files needed to use the IccProfLib library are installed in
the SampleICC subdirectory of the install prefix, e.g.
	/usr/local/include/SampleICC

Windows users, see README.win for build details.
