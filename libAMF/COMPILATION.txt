For compiling, you need to have:

- boost::uuid
- tinyxml2
- a bash shell environment

You can google them for getting the latest.

Compilation is done with cmake. 

So, to compile, you'd do (for windows 64):

$ notepad win64_vars # change paths to point to your locations
$ source win64_vars
$ mkdir build-win64
$ cd build-win64
$ cmake .. -G'NMake Makefiles' -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_ARCH=64
$ nmake

from a shell console.  In Windows, you can use mingw or cygwin, with the paths set up for the Microsoft compiler.


For Linux:

$ apt-get install libboost1.48-dev
$ apt-get install libtinyxml2
$ cd build-linux64
$ cmake .. -G'Unix Makefiles' -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ make
