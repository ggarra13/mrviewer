can have three different CTL transformations active at the same time.
&nbsp;One transform is attached to the main view window and represents
the monitor, video or film stock. &nbsp;This transform within the CTL
naming conventions is often called the Output Device Transform (ODT).
&nbsp;This transform is set in the main preferences window, in the CTL section. &nbsp;Most projects will require users to set the device transform only once and not change it.</p><p>mrViewer
ships with one basic ODT pass-thru display transform called
ODT_monitor.ctl. &nbsp;This transform should be suitable for displaying
images on a monitor device, as the only transformation performed on the
image is to apply the luminance and color primaries of your monitor.</p><p>An ODT that tries to emulate film will often require a more complex 2D or 3D table lookup
to try to emulate the inverse of the Print Film Emulation Transform
(PFET). &nbsp;The PFET is particular to each film stock and film
developing laboratory and generating it requires careful evaluation of
the film stock and developing conditions. &nbsp;For more information about creating the inverse PFET, you should consult your developing laboratory.</p><p>A
second transform available is the Rendering Transform or&nbsp;RT for
short. &nbsp; This transformation is unique to each image and project
and represents the transformation needed to take the RGB pixel values
stored in an image to a pleasing internal CIE XYZ representation for
the project. &nbsp;mrViewer ships with a basic Rendering Transform that
takes scene-linear RGB images to CIE XYZ by converting through HDTV
Rec709. &nbsp;Depending on the project, the rendering transform will
vary. &nbsp;In the future, AMPAS will provide a Reference Rendering
Transform for Film which may become the standard for most film
productions. &nbsp;If your project requires some special film effect
(like bleach film), a special render transform should be used.</p>A
third transform available is the Look Modification Transform (LMT).
&nbsp;This transformation is intended mainly for camera devices to take
their input images and color correct them based on certain knobs as
done on set and is particular to each camera model.<p></p></body></html>
