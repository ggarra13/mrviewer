<h2><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Starting mrViewer</span></h2>




mrViewer can be started in a variety of ways. &nbsp;<br>




<br>

<br>




If you have no icon on your desktop, the simplest way is
to go the place where mrViewer was installed, look for the directory
for the appropiate platform and architecture for your machine and click
on the:
<div class="hotkey">mrViewer.sh </div> ( Linux )
or <div class="hotkey">mrViewer.exe</div> ( Windows ) application icon.<br>




<br>




mrViewer can also be started from any command-line or shell window, as
mrViewer may have already added its path to your standard system PATH
variable. &nbsp;Open any shell window and then you can type in:<br>
<br>




<div class="console">&gt; mrViewer [-options] [&lt;images...&gt;]
</div>
<br>
<br>
On Linux, you would do:

<div class="console">&gt; mrViewer.sh [-options] [&lt;images...&gt;]
</div>
<br>

where -options are optional mrViewer command-line options
and&nbsp;images are optionally a list of images or sequences you
want
to display. &nbsp;For a list of valid options, use:<br>
<br>




<div class="console">&gt; mrViewer -h</div>
<br>
<br>

<br>
On certain platforms, like Windows, mrViewer can also associate itself
to several image and video files it knows about. In that case,
opening a Windows Explorer window and double-clicking on a file that
mrViewer recognizes may automatically invoke a new copy of mrViewer.

<br>
<br>
mrViewer will start in the natural language of the OS, if there are translations available.  If you want mrViewer to open always in English, set the environment variable:
<br>
On Linux bash:
<div class="console">
export LC_ALL=C
</div>
Under Windows, the setting is in the System Preferences, Advanced, Environment Variables.

<br>
If mrViewer has the single instance preference set, only one mrViewer will
get started and any other image that would go to a new viewer will get
redirected back to the first instance. <br>
In order for this to work, mrViewer creates a dummy lock file in your
home directory in:


<div class="console">$HOME/.fltk/filmaura/mrViewer.lock.prefs</div>
on linux
</br>
<br>
and</br>
<div class="console">
$USERPROFILE/filmaura/mrViewer.lock.prefs
</div>

If mrViewer crashes, that file might get left behind and prevent mrViewer from starting up.  Make sure you delete it manually in that case.
