v4.3.9   - Made ghosting be a global setting instead of a per shape
	   setting.  This allows easily changing the previous/next
	   ghosting value and see the result in real time.
	 - Added "Ghosting <previous> <next>" to list of reel commands
	   to control the ghosting of previous/next frames.  Note that
	   even thou it is a reel setting, only one setting is valid
	   per session (the last loaded).
	 - Improved OpenGL compatibility by drawing lines and points with
	   polygons and circles respectively.
	 - Increased the size of the eraser.
	 - Made swing looping work on a single image when loaded with no
	   background.
	 - Removed a crash in EDL when two sequences were played.

v4.3.8   - Bug fixed saving of shape in reel due to a typo (&d instead of
	   %d).
	 - Fixed playback of videos hanging up due to mutex lock in
	   ping-pong (swing) playback.

v4.3.7   - Made showing and hiding of windows be a command.  This makes
	   them thread safe.
	 - Bug fixed networking to work with multiple clients.
	   Previously, only one server and one client were accepted.
	 - Removed a nasty bug in the shaders' use which would trash
	   memory. This would make images appear green or gray sometimes.
	   It would also not show BG images when it should.
	 - Added previous and next frame counters to grease pencil
	   drawing shapes.  This replaces the single forwards/backwards
	   toggle that was there before.
	 - Made file requester of saving of reels start at the location of
	   the first image loaded, instead of the current location.
	 - Made saving of reel support saving the contents of the reel in
	   relative path mode.
	 - Added a Saving tab in the Preferences and two options to
	   control the last two changes.

v4.3.6   - Bug fixed limiting of images for formats without a
	   display window ( png, jpg, etc).  Now memory setting works
	   for them too, not just for exrs.
	 - Bug fixed memory limit in win32 to handle cases of out of
	   memory elegantly.  An out of memory will limit the Gb of
	   frames automatically.
	 - Bug fixed network connections to be thread safe.  Now they
	   work as they should.  There are some missing commands that
	   it won't handle yet, but most functionality is there.

v4.3.5   - Bug fixed CTL RRT transform not getting selected when it
	   was selected thru the menus.  The 8bits, 16bits, float, etc.
	   would work fine.
	 - Bug fixed audio scrubbing which would, in latest versions,
	   not work completely right.
	 - Preload cache now works correctly when auto playback is off.
	 - Bug fixed Windows' NVIDIA driver bug showing images with
	   upped gamma.

v4.3.4   - Bug fixed cache sliding when it was stopped near the end of
	   a sequence that did not have all frames cached.  This was
	   a Windows problem.
	 - Bug fixed cache looping.  Now the preload cache wraps
	   around the end and starts at the beginning again when
	   it is stopped near the end.
	 - Made start up time be much faster, as it now does not load
	   any frames until the GUI is up and idle.
	 - Made background image show on first run if it is different
	   than foreground image.  Note that this makes the gui a tad
	   slower on start up.

v4.3.3   - Bug fixed EDL playback as it had gotten broken with the new
	   timeline algorithm.
	 - Note that playback of BG images works only when the FG caches
	   are full or, alternatively, when not using cache nor play all
	   frames.

v4.3.2   - Improved cache loading of 4K and 8K images.  Now the timeline
	   will recycle those according to a setting in Gb.  The setting,
	   Preferences->Cache->Maximum Memory allows you to set a
	   maximum memory for all the cache frames, after which, they
	   are recycled.
	 - Improved cache playback sliding itself to the next available
	   frames to continue playback when playback is stopped.
	 - Added a Preferences->Playback->Play All Frames switch to play
	   all frames of a sequence without skipping any.  This is
	   similar to cache active when the image is high res (4K/6K/8K).
	   It is on by default and recommended to leave it that way.

v4.3.1   - Reverted saving of movies with audio.
	   This had gotten broken when the display of in/out in the
	   timeline was added.
	   Note that saving with audio has some problems in some rare
	   movie files that create very short gaps (stutters) in the audio.
	   Also, saving movies with audio is slow.  It is recommended
	   you use the ffmpeg standalone that ships with mrViewer
	   for any sort of audio manipulation.
	 - Added libx265.so to Linux distribution as it was missing.
	 - Made S/E buttons set the in and out points of the movie that
	   is to be saved.
	 - Made Linux distribution not use rpath anymore in any of its
	   libraries.  This makes sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH works correctly.
	   Updated utils/libs.rb accordingly to do it automatically.
	 - Made GLSL shaders compatible with Mesa library on Linux, as
	   they were reporting a bunch of errors.

v4.3.0   - Made loading of sequences much more interactive and faster.
	   Now the GUI does not lock itself as much.
	 - The option of missing frames now is more interactive.  It only
	   needs to clear the cache to refresh the image gaps.  There's no
	   need to quit mrViewer.

v4.2.9   - Added an option in Preferences->Loading to select how missing
	   frames are displayed.  Currently, the options are as a black
	   frame, as a repeated frame, or as a repeated frame with a red
	   cross in the middle.
	 - Updated libraries to latest OpenEXR (v2.3).
	 - Bug fixed an incompatability issue with the FFMPEG libraries.
	 - Bug fixed an incompatability issue with the NVIDIA cg shader-
	   compiler.

v4.2.8   - Added %ENVVAR% and ${ENVVAR} support to OCIO environment variable.
	   The two syntaxes work on both platforms.  This allows the OCIO
	   variable to be defined, like this example:
	   under Linux syntax:
	     $ export OCIO=/mnt/show/${SHOW}/${SHOT}/ocio/config.ocio
	   or in Windows syntax:
	     $ setx   OCIO 'D:/show/%SHOW%/%SHOT%/ocio/config.ocio'
	   and then set SHOW and SHOT in the environment that calls mrViewer.
	 - Made HDR shader show when _has_hdr is set.  This variable is only
	   set when the shader type is GL.
	 - Made HDR shader reset itself on new image foreground.  Currently,
	   it is not possible to have a YCbCr shader in the foreground
	   (HDR10, for example) and a different one in the background (SDR).
	 - Bug fixed a bug in looping that got introduced in v4.2.5 and was
	   NOT fixed in v4.2.6.  Now loop works correctly instead of continu-
	   ing on sometimes after the last frame.
	 - Added missing libACESlib.so to Linux distribution.

v4.2.7   - Bug fixed missing DLLs on Windows distributions.

v4.2.6   - Bug fixed a bug in looping which got introduced in v4.2.5.
	 - Bug fixed audio sync in stepping or scrubbing.  Previously, they
	   would repeat the audio frames.

	 - Added support for multithreading decoding of video in movies.  This
	   is needed to play 4K movies in real time.  The setting of automatic
	   threads is 0 in Preferences->Video->Number of Video Threads.

	 - Added support for HDR10 movies.  They need the 16-bit toggle in
	   Preferences->Loading and OpenGL shaders (export MRV_SHADER_TYPE=GL).
	   Since these movies are 4K, you should also watch them with 0 video
	   threads (auto video threads).
	   This is a beta feature.  We need to know if it creates some problems
	   in the compiling/linking of the shader under different gfx cards,
	   as we are trying to use the lowest compatibility layer possible.

	 - Bug fixed BT709 matrix.

v4.2.5   - Improved cache significantly by changing its algorithm.  Now OIIO
	   loading works much responsive and faster.

v4.2.4   - Improved cache slightly.

v4.2.3   - Allowed movies to be stored as 16-bits when the source is 10 or 16
	   bits.  This consumes much more memory but it is more accurate.
	   This option is off by default.  It must be activated in the
	   Loading section of the Preferences.
	 - Added a Waveform monitor to mrViewer.  This works mostly in 8 bits.
	   It downgrades other formats to 8 bits (without taking into account
	   lut or gamma).

v4.2.2   - Added interpreting foundry's YCbCr metadata for matrix
	   transformation.
	   Currrently, this leads to Rec 709 being added in the mrViewer
	   color pipeline.
	 - Bug fixed out of memory errors to not crash the viewer.
	 - Changed caching to a new algorithm that works better and
	   faster.  It allows caching large scale images with audio, as
	   long as memory is available to handle all the frames.

v4.2.1   - Bug fixed a minor memory trashing in ICC browser.
	 - Added back subtitles on Linux as ffmpeg was being compiled
	   without libass due to a change in the ffmpeg Makefiles.
	 - Improved performance of video decoding for yuv444p10le, which
	   had gotten worse in v4.2.0.
	 - Removed most tsan warnings.

v4.2.0   - Bug fixed versioning with prefix of v only and matching movie
	   files, like test.mov.  The substring would index beyond the file
	   size, aborting the program.
	 - Bug fixed printing specifier in memory display ( PRIu64 instead
	   of PRId64 ).
	 - Removed a memory leak when changing image version due to
	   thumbnail image being left behind.
	 - Bug fixed precache when gaps are found as this got broken along
	   the way when adding the code to versioning.
	 - Bug fixed precache when first frame was not 1 for OIIO.
	 - Bug fixed auto reloading of frames when the format was one of
	   OIIO.
	 - Bug fixed scrubbing getting turned off after using the drawing
	   tool.
	 - Bug fixed a bunch of tsan (ThreadSanitizer) warnings.

v4.1.9   - Removed a subtle bug in looping images that did not start at 1.
	   The result would go unnoticed, but internally a wrong frame would
	   get carried.
	 - Made a second attempt at FFMPEG jpg/png/dpx loaders.  With the
	   fix above, all seems correct.  You can now switch from
	   FFMPEG, to OIIO or to ImageMagick.
	 - Bug fixed a race condition in OIIO readers which could crash
	   the viewer.  This would mostly be seen when loading DPX
	   files with the layer menu/shortcuts creation.
	 - Made OIIO readers the default readers as they handle 10 and 16
	   bit images correctly and image sequence gaps.
	 - Made versioning support _v with no version number and not
	   interpret it as 0, but just skip it.
	 - Bug fixed versioning for prefixes different than 2 characters.
	 - Bug fixed Favorites listing in FLU file requester.  Now they
	   are listed in several columns if there are too many.
	   Previously, they would get listed in a single column and
	   scrolling would corrupt the view.

v4.1.8   - Added .rgbe and .hdri as valid HDR image extensions.
	 - Added versioning to the sequences/movies.
	   This allows to handle clips of the same shot, but different
	   versions as one object. For example if you place a clip with
	   .../SHOT001_v005/SHOT001_v005.%04d.exr
	   in the reel/timeline, and there is another sequence with:
	   .../SHOT001_v008/SHOT001_v008.%04d.exr on disk,
	   you can step through versions by pressing ALT+PgUp (previous
	   version) or ALT+PgDown (next version).
	   The version number is found by a prefix, by default '_v'.
	   This can be changed in the Loading section of the preferences.
	   Note that the version numbers cannot be more than 10 numbers
	   apart by default.  This can be changed in the
	   Preferences->Loading->Max Frames Apart section of the
	   preferences.
	 - Bug fixed a movie playback problem that was introduced in
	   v4.1.1.  Looping would not work properly with some movies and
	   you'd get a decode error on the first frame of the movie file.
	 - Bug fixed a bunch of issues in the EDL / BG image playback.
	 - Reverted the use of FFMPEG for PNG/JPG loading as it was
	   not caching properly.  Some frames would get repetitions.

v4.1.7   - Switched to OIIO's HDR image loader and saver as it is more
	   robust than the original Radiance one I was using.
	 - Added HDRI saver.
	 - Made HDRI saver allow saving a crop region of the view (smaller
	   data window than display window).
	 - Bug fixed EDL editing start and end frames shifting.
	 - Made PNG/JPG FFMPEG reader work properly once the images were
	   cached.  Now it works realtime with images that are 4K once
	   they are cached.
	 - Reverted naming convention to not use the YYYYMMDD format in
	   archive name, as it was making other web pages not able to
	   link to the download directly.

v4.1.6   - Bug fixed hdrImage.cpp which was incorrectly optimized.
	 - Put back the reporting of LUTs as they are used as it was
	   unclear before which lut was being used.
	 - OIIO now has its own requester to save files.  This is mainly
	   to support MipMap saving to .tx files.
	 - OIIO now has faster loading of tiff files.
	 - Bug fixed installer to make it show the icon once again on
	   Linux.
	 - Re-added Libraw to oiiotool on Windows. Sent the changes to
	   github.

v4.1.5   - Made Cancel of save movie file not pop up a requester for a
	   proper filename with %d symbol.
	 - Fixed GBRP10LE video color option in ffv1 video.  Previously,
	   it would get reported as pix_fmt -1.
	 - Changed code to OIIO reader of JPG/PNG files to be handled by
	   FFMPEG by default and keep the cache as long as the image cache.
	   This should bring the best of both worlds (FFMPEG faster loading
	   with long image caches).  Neither OIIO nor ImageMagick then will
	   get used.
	 - Fixed EDL cuts reverting to OCIO's scene_linear color space.
	   Now the color space of the clip is kept on both sides of the
	   cut.
	 - Removed random crashes when loading dpx files (on Windows).
	 - Removed crash when loading a reel with an invalid (missing)
	   filename.
	 - Removed random crashes when loading multiple sequences/movies
	   thru drag and drop.
	   Note that if the drag and drop comes from the native file chooser,
	   it is necessary to close it so that mrViewer can resume normal
	   operation.
	 - Made PgUp/PgDown switching of images keep the frame number when
	   possible as that's the most sensible thing to do.
	 - Added LMB+Drag once again to select an area, which had gone
	   missing.

v4.1.4   - Removed debugging statements from exrImage.cpp.
	 - Made EXR reader read channels in good sorted order in multipart
	   files so RGBA will appear sorted like that, while XYZ will sort
	   like that.
	 - EXR reader now appends the root name to the channel name when it
	   is not already present.  This helps in multiview EXRs to
	   distinguish right and left pair of images.
	 - EXR reader/saver now keeps Color/RGBAZ in their original locations
	   when reading/saving a multichannel or multipart OpenEXR.  This
	   means Color, Red, Green, Blue, Alpha and Z remain at the top of
	   the list.  This option will not work with previously saved images
	   with the Color at the middle of the list.
	 - EXR reader now reads stereo files properly once again.
	 - Made the Pixel Value pulldown more correctly reflect the options.
	   They are Full (gain, gamma and lut), Lut( gain and lut) and
	   Original (raw pixels).
	 - Made changing images keep the frame number if possible.
	 - Made center an image that is not loaded work properly.
	 - Added FFV1 codec to save movie requester.
	 - Added a switch in Preferences->Loading to select OIIO as the
	   default JPG/PNG loader instead of FFMPEG.  This helps with loading
	   very large JPG/PNG files which cannot be played in real time.

v4.1.3   - Native file requester on Windows does not leave their menus open
	   and obstructing the view.
	 - Previous channel hotkey now works correctly on Color channel when
	   this channel is in the middle of the channel list.
	 - Previous channel hotkey now works correctly on Color channel when
	   the following channel would be alpha overlay (no more than RGBA
	   is loaded).
	 - Previous channel hotkey now works correctly on Color channel when
	   the following channel would be a lumma (RGB or Y,RY,BY only is
	   loaded).
	 - Bug fixed IFF image reader to work as all other image readers,
	   reading the header chunk on each fetch.  Improved the fetching to
	   only fetch once instead of twice as before.
	 - Made all shortcuts be a toggle (Z, N, C, R, G, B, A, L and V)
	   between their counter parts and the previously selected channel.
	 - Made image switching keep the layer selected when possible.  Note
	   that this feature does not always work particularly when toggling
	   the shortcuts (specially when dealing with multipart openexrs),
	   so it should be considered alpha.
	 - Made use OCIO button be like the rest of the buttons instead of
	   a gray one.

v4.1.2   - Updated FFMPEG to a later (almost latest) version.
	 - Improvements to channel/layer usage per request from Dominik Pott:
		* Next/Previous channel hotkeys are less granular.  They now
		  jump RGBA channel groups.
		* Switching to the Z channel no longer breaks the hotkeys of
		  RGBA.
		* Channel names are now sorted according to function (ex.
		  XYZ, RGB, etc ).
		* Precaching now starts from the current frame, not from
		  the start.
		* Changing channels past the last or first channel loops
		  to the beginning and to the end channels respectively.
		* There's a new hotkey (e) to toggle two channels for easy
		  comparison.
		* The cache now respects the IN/OUT points in the timeline
		  and won't cache further than that, except it has already
		  been cached.
		* The hotkeys have been changed so that 'c' always brings
		  you to the color image, while r,g,b change based on what
		  group of channels you have selected ( N, P, etc ).
	 - On Windows, the file requester is the native one by default now.
	   This effects both loading and saving.  Note that if you have
	   preferences saved, you will need to remove it for this to take
	   effect or save a new preferences with the native switch on.
	 - Bug fixed EXR saver to not repeat main layer name twice and
	   breaking the multipart saving.

v4.1.1   - Bug fixed switching FG/BG images where the start/end frames were
	   different.  Previously, this would lead to a hang.
	 - Improved playback of short FG in loop with a long clip in BG.
	   Previously, this would lead to a crash or to a mutex lock.
	 - Removed the final code in time2frames() which was wrong and
	   causing havok.
	 - Updated oiio and oiiotool to the latest prerelease version.
	   Note that on windows 32 bits, the code does not use SIMD
	   optimizations.
	 - Added Libs that OIIO is compiled with to the About window of
	   mrViewer.

v4.1.0   - Bug fixes to the choco installer and uninstaller.  The installer
	   now modifies the machine PATH instead of the user PATH variable.
	   It also creates the shortcut in the All Users/Desktop.
	   And it creates a shortcut in the Common Start Menu.
	 - Added a Image->Switch FG/BG Images to toggle the foreground and
	   background images, for easy comparing of two sequences and keep
	   the same frame around.
	 - Added a shortcut 'j' to switch (jump) between FG and BG images.
	   This is to be used to keep the same frame in both the FG and BG.
	   Otherwise, only the FG image drives the same frame.
	 - Bug fixed a seek issue when setting BG image.  The playback
	   and stepping among frames would not work anymore.
	 - Bug fixed a crash in EDL Edit window when dropping a clip onto
	   a new track.
	 - Removed the message of already created OCIO transform as it was
	   too verbose.
	 - Bug fixed a playback hanging when in EDL mode, after stopping
	   a short sequence or movie file and continuing it later on.  The
	   playback would not continue to the next image in the sequence.
	 - Bug fixed changing FPS in EDL mode.  The playback would get
	   corrupted.  This change reverts looping working in time instead
	   of frames, as it was that change that was causing problems.

v4.0.9   - A bug fix release to playback of movies with sound in loop, which
	   was crashing v4.0.6 and later.
	 - Bug fixed pixel ratio not being correct and being applied twice.

v4.0.8   - Made HEVC saver report a HVC1 fourcc so that Apple products will
	   recognize them and show a thumbnail.
	 - Made Z Depth be reported as "Z" only, as that makes it work on
	   different languages when saving EXRs.
	 - Bug fixed Z channel selection being chosen as Color.
	 - Made OIIO iff saver save only up to 16-bits, as float is not
	   supported.  Note that OIIO's IFF saver does not support Z channel.
	 - Added --stereo-input flag to command-line.  It works just like
	   --stereo-output flag but for the stereo input.
	 - Bug fixed X and Y flips which got broken in a previous build.
	 - Bug fixed pixel aspect ratio being applied twice.

v4.0.7   - Added support for libraw in oiiotool on Windows.  This allows us
	   to support dng, cr2, etc. formats.
	 - Added oiiotool to Linux distribution.
	 - Added support for ffmpeg in oiiotool.  This allows using
	   oiiotool for ffmpeg input formats to extract single frames and
	   process them.
	 - Added --stereo-output flag to command line.  This controls the
	   stereo output setting when loading a stereo set of images.
	   Options are: Left view, Right view, Top/bottom, Bottom/top,
			Left/right, Right/left, Even/odd rows,
			Even/odd columns, Checkerboard pattern,
			Red/cyan glasses, Cyan/red glasses.
	 - Reverted the change to timecode/timeline accepting view shortcuts
	   as it was causing conflict with the presentation mode.
	 - Improved loading of IFF images to not consume so much memory.
	   They will no longer load as float images, but as 8 bits or 16
	   bits images.  Also bug fixed the RLE decoding.
	 - Added support for reading Z depth channel in maya IFF files.
	 - Improved channel toggling to not conflict with image loaders.
	   This is mainly an internal change.
	 - Bug fixed saving of unknown channel name in OpenEXR saver.

v4.0.6   - Bug fixed looping in movies with an In/Out points.  Now the
	   looping is more frame accurate.
	 - Further improved playback of two video tracks as stereo 3d.
	 - Improved timecode/frame, timeline widgets allowing all the
	   shortcuts of the main image view.
	 - Made LUT be on as a default option and the 8 bits OCIO default be
	   sRGB.
	   This change is only present if starting mrViewer without
	   preferences set.
	   It makes 8 bit formats (png, jpeg, etc) behave like
	   expected under the nuke-default ocio config, while linear formats
	   like HDR, OpenEXR, etc. behave also well.
	   This change is to make mrViewer behave with LUTs just as when it
	   was using gamma 2.2 only.
	 - Made Active Views' environment variable OCIO_ACTIVE_VIEWS return
	   sRGB, rec709, Film, Log, Raw or None in that order on linux as
	   the active_view setting in the yaml config.ocio file was not
	   respected on that platform.  This is a bug fix work-around.

v4.0.5   - Bug fixed a crash when reading corrupt EXR files.
	 - Reversed the order of lut baking/gamma change in MIFF, TIFF,
	   PIC and PSD.
	 - Removed a debugging message printing "f " and the frame when
	   playback started.
	 - Improved performance of ocio baking by avoiding gamma changes
	   too, unless they are needed.
	 - Added T (toggle lut) shortcut to list of shortcuts.
	 - Added Ctrl+p (toggle pixel ratio) to list of shortcuts.
	 - Made the S and E buttons (and the corresponding I and O
	   shortcuts) set the start/end frame of the timeline but not by
	   shrinking the timeline, but by highlighting the area instead.
	   This is a preference option in:
		Preferences->Playback->Timeline->Selection.

v4.0.4   - When lut is active, saving to a MIFF, TIFF, PNG, PIC and PSD
	   will bake the lut in the picture.
	 - Made lut more verbose, printing out the lut when it is not
	   created, too.
	 - Bug fixed alpha channel presence in imagemagick wand loader.
	   Previously, it would tag all images with alpha channel and
	   lead to reporting of colors to 0 premult when no alpha was
	   there.
	 - Made saving of TIFF and PNG sequences several times faster.
	 - Added support for alpha channel in YUVA movies, even if a
	   shader is not available.  This allows viewing the alpha
	   channel of ProRes 4444 movies.
	 - Added saving of alpha channel when codec is prores_ks and
	   YUV format is YUV444.
	 - Bug fixed stereo display of inferior/superior which was
	   placing both images one on top of each other.
	 - Bug fixed stereo looping of image sequences.  Previously the
	   loop would not happen.  Looping of two movie tracks or movies
	   was okay.

v4.0.3   - Bug fixed jpeg loader (ffmpeg) to support .jpeg extension
	   besides jpg.
	 - When lut is active, saving to a movie file will now bake the
	   OCIO transforms.  As the best movie depth is 16bits, the baking
	   is not perfect, thou, so you might find color incongruencies.
	 - Made gamma LUT requester behave a tad better.  When you select
	   a non-view item like default or DCPI3, nothing will change.

v4.0.2   - Bug fixed GLSL 2.0 YCrCbA shader to not throw a syntax error.
	   This makes mrViewer's YUVA work with other graphic cards other
	   than NVidia (ATI, Intel, etc).  Note that the YUVA mrViewer
	   pipeline has not been developed yet.
	 - Added some changes to OpenGL color selection in windows to try
	   to avoid a conflict with Windows 7's Aero.
	 - Removed rpath from IlmCtl and IlmCtlSimd libraries, as it was
	   not allowing LD_LIBRARY_PATH to work properly.

v4.0.1   - Bug fixed GLSL 2.0 YCrCb shader to not throw a syntax error.
	   This makes mrViewer work with other graphic cards other than
	   NVidia (ATI, Intel, etc).
	 - Bug fixed jpeg loader (ffmpeg), to load files starting at other
	   frames than 1.

v4.0.0   - Improved loop sync in fg/bg image playback.
	 - Improved loop sync in 3D stereo playback.
	 - Made loop work in time instead of frames.  That allows looping
	   properly two different videos with different fps.
	 - Made a change in GLEW initialization which should improve OpenGL
	   compatibility.
	 - Improved DSO compatibility in Linux distribution.  Previously,
	   it could lead to broken depencies if IlmCtl was compiled with
	   different settings.

v3.9.9   - Bug fixed View change in gamma panel which got broken in v3.9.8.

v3.9.8   - Added OCIO ICS/Display/View changes on a network connection.
	 - Added CTL IDT/RT/ODT in network connections.
	 - Bug fixed Add to Favorites in file requester as it was not
	   adding any favorites.  Regression to sorting alphabetically.
	 - Added ACES ASC CDL transforms to network connections.

v3.9.7   - Made Action Tool - Move Picture work as intended.  It allows
	   selecting images where the alpha is not 0 and drag them around
	   on the infinite canvas.
	 - Added a cache specific to image sequences.  Now it is possible
	   to set the image cache be smaller than the timeline to save
	   memory.  A value of -1 (default) keeps the old behavior.

v3.9.6   - Solidified Window's maximize button to also work when the
	   taskbar is not at the bottom of the screen or is of diferent
	   size as default.
	 - Added a command-line option to start the video/image playing.
	   The shortcut is -P and the full option is --playback.
	 - Detected JPEG file format with ffmpeg instead of with
	   ImageMagick, as the reader is faster and can read more bitdepths.
	 - Made Favorites pulldown and window report the files in
	   alphabetical order.
	 - Bug fixed Favorites pulldown in file requester as it was
	   broken.
	 - Bug fixed compositing when resize is on.  It was not scaling
	   the image properly in most cases.

v3.9.5   - Made cache preloading's default to on.  This will take effect
	   only if you open a fresh mrViewer with no preferences saved.
	 - Made message when selecting an ocio input color space based on
	   bit depth a tad more clear.  It is now reported what bit depth
	   it selected as default.
	 - Made Preference Window's Revert/Cancel/Save buttons more clearly
	   visible.
	 - Bug fixed maximize button on Windows which would place the window
	   below the taskbar.
	 - Bug fixed picking an OCIO config from the 3D LUT preference
	   when another has been selected previously.

v3.9.4   - Bug fixed Video timecode not being read in Spanish locale.
	 - Made SHIFT+LMB + drag draw a selection area (temporarily
	   switching from Scrub mode).
	 - Made tooltips in input color space report useful information.

v3.9.3   - Removed incorrect message about OCIO default for an image.
	 - Added message of OCIO default and OCIO taken from name of image.
	 - Made all shaders calculate gain before lut.  This allows exposure
	   to work correctly.
	 - Made all color calculations (color picker, color area, vectorscope
	   and histogram) take gain before lut to allow for exposure to work
	   properly.
	 - Made input color space be taken from image filename following
	   Sony's conventions.
	 - Bug fixed RY/BY/Y channel selection in luminance/chrominance
	   images.  Regression from an old version of mrViewer.
	 - Bug fixed color values showing as NANs when alpha was 0 due to
	   unpremult.

v3.9.2   - Fixed 'h' (Center Image) when the image was straight.  Regression
	   from 3.9.1.
	 - Fixed Text tool in Linux.  Previously the text would not appear
	   at all or it would show as black squares.
	 - Made OCIO Lut be a 3 channel lut, while CTL remains a 4 channel
	   lut.  This saves some memory and calculation time when using OCIO.
	 - Made OCIO Pick button in the Media Info window also update the
	   OCIO Input Color Space pull down.
	 - Made mousewheel in pulldown menus a no-op to avoid hanging.
	   This required a change in fltk's Menu_popup.cxx to set MODAL to
	   false.
	 - Fixed move picture tool to move also the data window.
	 - Fixed Masking and Safe Areas on rotation of image.
	 - Fixed OCIO default scene_linear which would not appear in
	   the ICS popup menu as selected when it was the default space.
	 - Added hotkey (SHIFT+i) to toggle Input Color Space popup and
	   fstop controls when Use OCIO is in effect.

v3.9.1   - Improved fixed pixel color when alpha was set to 0.  mrViewer
	   would incorrectly do a premult of the alpha.  Regression of
	   v3.9.0.
	 - Cosmetic change.  Gamma button will no longer display long
	   transform view names and will truncate them to the widget size.
	 - Gamma button will always display the current OCIO view
	   transform.
	 - Bug fixed alpha display in Area Color Information.  Previously
	   it would always display it as black.
	 - Fixed CentOS 7 compatibility by including libstdc++ and
	   libgcc_s DSOs to the distribution.
	 - Added an Optional Image Color Space pulldown to the top
	   toolbar.  It is activated when using ocio and the option
	   to the toolbar has been selected in the main LUT preference.
	 - Bug fixed sequences of numbers.ext only, like 00001.exr, 00002.exr,
	   etc.  Both the command line as well as the file requester now
	   support them.
	 - Added an "inputColorSpace" attribute to EXRs to save out/load in
	   the input color space.

v3.9.0   - Bug fixed coordinate system for drawing, selection, safe
	   areas, etc.
	 - Bug fixed off by 1 in mouse coordinates.
	 - Added support for OCIO's Views to be accessed directly from
	   the gamma pulldown.  As a convenience, when an OCIO view is
	   selected the LUT button is turned on and the gamma is set to
	   1.0.
	 - Made OCIO's default config be nuke-default's, which now ships
	   with mrViewer.
	 - Fixed selection rectangle.
	 - Added 90 degree rotations to the images.  There's no image
	   format that sets them.  It is just a user hotkey and menu.
	   They can be used together with flipping of images.
	   Also, area selection DOES work properly on rotated images.
	   However, rotations cannot yet be used with images that
	   have data_window != display window.

v3.8.9   *** RECALLED DUE TO BUGS IN SELECTION AREAS AND OTHERS ***

v3.8.8   - Bug fixed reversed coordinates as done in v3.8.6 as it
	   was causing problems with area selection and with exr's
	   with data window != display window.
	 - Added https://youtu.be/BLX9Pwcny2c OCIO video tutorial.

v3.8.7   - Improved detection of .hdri images to support those saved
	   from Photoshop (#?RGBE instead of #?RADIANCE).
	 - Removed error when creating thumbnails of RAW formats.
	 - Added support for mipmapsx in .tx files.  Now Media Info
	   Window has a slider to change mipmap levels.
	 - Removed crash in Clone Image when cloning a previously cloned
	   image.
	 - Added some partial EXIF data support to rawImage formats.
	 - Added all metadata in .tx images.
	 - Updated About messages to include OpenColorIO, OpenImageIO
	   and Libraw copyrights and versions.
	 - Added a Pixel Toolbar tab in Preferences to control how
	   the pixel toolbar behaves on startup.

v3.8.6   - Bug fixed GLSL shaders to support scale and offset.
	 - Removed a syntax error in GLSL rgba shader.
	 - Added support for CR2, DNG, NEF, RAF formats through libraw.
	 - Added support for Arnold's .tx format thru OIIO on Windows.
	 - Reversed coordinate system to make it compatible with Nuke
	   and Natron.  Now 0,0 is the bottom left corner insted of the
	   top left corner.
	 - Updated to newer compilers.  On Windows, VC2015.  On Linux,
	   gcc-4.9.

v3.8.5   - Added tooltips to all OCIO color spaces and to the Config line.
	 - Allowed changing OCIO config file from the Preference window.
	 - Added a button to toggle OCIO on and off.  By default, it is
	   on.
	 - Added the environment variable MRV_OCIO_8bits_ICS,
	   MRV_OCIO_16bits_ICS, MRV_OCIO_32bits_ICS, MRV_OCIO_float_ICS
	   to control the default input color space for the corresponding
	   type of image.
	 - Reversed image coordinates to match Nuke/Natron.  Now the left
	   bottom corner is 0,0, while the top right one is width/height.


v3.8.4   - Add a CUBE regex line in cube2ctl.rb/py for compatability with
	   some cube luts.
	 - Added Move Picture Tool to the Action's toolbar.  This tool allows
	   moving the pictures in the canvas to, for example, position two
	   shots side by side.
	   Currently, only two images can be placed (front and back).
	 - Bug Fixed bg image being loaded twice when stereo images were
	   loaded command-line.
	 - Added OCIO support.  Currently this means it reads the OCIO
	   environment variable, and a new RMB menu called OCIO appears,
	   while all the CTL/ICC menus disappear.

v3.8.3   - Made choco uninstall remove the mrViewer directory.
	 - Improved bug error reporting of different ODTs when loading one
	   incompatible from the ACESclip file.  Now the message names both
	   ODT names.
	 - Added TIFF with JPEG support to ctlrender standalone executable
	   on 64 bits Windows.
	 - Bug fixed a crash in presentation mode (F12).

v3.8.2   - Added Actions to Preferences.  With them you can select the
	   action that opens at start-up (scrubbing, drawing, color area
	   selection, etc).
	 - Added hotkeys to all window popups (F4-F9).  You can, for
	   example, pop up the reel window with F4, the media info
	   window with F5, the Color Area Window with F6, The Action
	   Window with F7, the 3D Stereo VR360 options with F8
	   and Preferences with F9.
	 - Reverted back to VC2013 on Windows, to make the compilation
	   work under Windows 7 and Vista.  Windows 7 was broken due
	   to the switch to VC2015 (which would compile with the 10 SDK).

v3.8.1   - ***IMPORTANT***
	   Made Scrubbing work with the left mouse button only.
	   The default behavior of the left mouse drag is now scrubbing.
	   There's no need to use SHIFT/CTRL combo.
	   You can use the Action Tools Window (renamed from Paint Tools
	   Window) to change it back to area selection, draw pencil, draw
	   text or eraser, besides scrubbing.
	   Removed the scrubbing shortcut.
	 - Removed work-around for subtitles with ' as a sea of backslashes
	   quotes the file just fine.  Same with file paths with : in them.
	 - Bug fixed adding subtitles to audio files only.  This is not
	   allowed.
	 - Added missing movie extensions to file requester.  Now: asf,
	   avc, avchd, m2ts, m2t, ogm, ogv and ts are listed as movie files.
	   Previously, they would be hidden.
	 - Made file requester list appropiate files for file extensions
	   when the file requester has already been opened once.
	 - Made the EDL timeline follow the viewer's timeline so it will
	   show the current frame when the EDL Window is opened.
	 - Made EDL Edit window support PageUp/PageDown shortcuts to go to
	   the next or previous image sequence/movie.
	 - Made Compositing->Scale the BG image to the FG image size, when
	   unselected, place the BG image in the center of the screen,
	   instead of in a corner.
	 - Made SOP GUI hide when in presentation mode.
	 - Made SOP LUT update when switching images with different LUTs.
	 - Made SOP GUI update when switching images.

v3.8.0   - Bug fixed cutting of clips in EDL Window leaving the right clip
	   with no audio.
	 - Changing OpenGL Blend Mode in Preferences now updates the view
	   interactively, without having to press OK.
	 - Bug fixed 3D Stereo view when in VR Sphere mode.  Previously,
	   moving the view would only move one eye (leaving the cyan, for
	   example, in the same place).  This was a regression from v3.7.8.
	 - Made preferences a tad more pretty (boxes aligning, etc).
	 - Allowed loading of subtitles from the command-line
	   ( -u <srtfile> or --sub <srtfile> ).  It can be specified
	   multiple times to load subtitles for multiple movies.  Only one
	   subtitle per movie is allowed.
	 - Made subtitle appear on both images of a stereo video when the
	   stereo comes from two movie files or a movie with two tracks.
	   Previously only the left eye would show subtitles.
	   Movies which encode both stereo images in a single image
	   (top/bottom, left/right) do not yet work.
	 - Made Preferences->Auto Refit Image more intelligent.  When
	   switching images with PgUp/PgDown they will not refit themselves
	   if zoomed and the two images have the same display window.
	   Previously, if Auto Refit was set in the preferences, the refit
	   would happen regardless.
	 - Made maximum zoom reach x64 times to match the small resolution
	   of some samples in ffmpeg.
	 - Added support to encoding in subtitles in the
	   Preferences/Subtitles, to allow for subtitles in different
	   languages other than English.  ISO-8859-1/2 and UTF-8/16
	   are supported as pulldowns but they are not the only ones.
	   You can also type in the encoding yourself.
	 - Added a work-around to play subtitle files with ' in their names.
	   Basically, the subtitle is copied to $TEMP without the '.

v3.7.9   - Allowed saving movies in all formats, not just avi, mov and wmv.
	   This includes mkv, ogv, etc.
	 - Added support for x265 (HEVC) saving ( Profiles Main, Main10 and
	   RExt ).  Loading was already working.
	 - Made the movie and image saving popup windows appear on the
	   center of the screen, instead of randomly placing it.
	 - Made profiles change when the codec is changed in the movie
	   saving window.  Now the profile reflects the available profiles
	   for a codec.

v3.7.8   - Removed filtering on VR 360 Cube to avoid seams.
	 - Fixed rotation of VR360 cube/sphere when a background image was
	   present and then turned off.  Previously, the geometry would get
	   the rotation wrong.  Also, the code is now faster.
	 - Added a version check to cube2ctl.rb and 3dl2ctl.rb, as they
	   require at least v1.9 of ruby.
	 - Added 192x192x192 and 256x256x256 to LUT sizes.  The new sizes
	   consume a lot of memory but they are really accurate.
	 - Removed a crash on windows on an assert() of audio buffers
	   being aligned in mrvWaveEngine.cppp.
	   The assert was wrong as it was casting the pointer to unsigned
	   long.

v3.7.7   - Preload cache now works when changing channels.  Previously,
	   the cache would not get refreshed.
	 - Cache is smart enough to not reload channel changes to
	   U, V, W or R, G, B, A or X, Y, Z (albeit Z channel sometimes
	   may trigger a reload).
	 - Preferences->Positioning: Fixed Size will now keep the size of
	   the window even when loading a large image.
	   Same with Fixed Position.  It will keep the window position.
	 - Made Add Attribute refresh the view window.  This updates
	   things like the timecode HUD display.
	 - Added a first pass at VR 360 Cube Map.  You can find it in
	   the Stereo 3D Options panel.  This setting takes a
	   strip of 6 images as OpenEXR uses and maps them onto a cube,
	   similar to VR360 Sphere.  Note that there are currently
	   seams in the edges of the cube map.

v3.7.6   - Added a Positioning tab to Preferences.  In it, you can set
	   the position and size of the view window so that it always
	   opens in the same place and at the same size.
	 - Added a button to take the position and size parameters from
	   the current settings in the view window.
	 - Removed crashes on network connections when the server is
	   closed.
	 - Fixed audio sync on Windows when audio channels equals one.

v3.7.5   - Bug fixed audio scrubbing not choosing the right frames.
	   Sorting by the pts of the packet rather than the frame would
	   not work.

v3.7.4   - Made saving of frames in OpenEXR save out the
	   current timecode for the frame instead of the start timecode
	   for the sequence.
	 - Bug fixed 1D LUTs in cube2ctl.py.  Previously there were
	   syntax errors.
	 - Bug fixed audio scrubbing not working anymore since v3.7.2.

v3.7.3   - Made VR360 work in network connections.
	 - Made VR360 not take so many CPU cycles.  Now it is a light
	   process.
	 - Bug fixed a problem on Windows' audio not playing files
	   with very fast frame rates (239.846 fps).
	 - Bug fixed flipping of image in X and Y when in VR360 mode.
	 - File requester allows movies with the % character in them.
	 - File requester allows utf8 characters in filenames.
	 - Added Compositing Tab to Preferences.  You can now toggle the
	   resizing of the background image.
	 - Bug fixed gamma lookup of background image when in compositing
	   mode.

v3.7.2   - Bug fixed setting image as background when it was done thru
	   the menu in the view or reel window.  Previously, the reel
	   would not get stored and this would lead to a crash.
	 - Bug fixed channel selection on network connections.
	 - Bug fixed gamma setting on network connections, when switching
	   images.
	 - Added cube2ctl.py and 3dl2ctl.py.  These are Python ports of
	   the Ruby versions (cube2ctl.rb and 3dl2ctl.rb).  They both work
	   practically the same and produce identical output.
	 - Fixed movie files with 3 periods in them being recognized as
	   image sequences when the extension was unknown.
	 - Fixed loading many movies and reaching the maximum of audio
	   file descriptors.
	 - Added optionally saving the metadata for movies.

v3.7.1   - Bug fixed 3D stereo playback to sync the two tracks on loops.
	 - Bug fixed a sequence detection when files were called
	   1234.psd or 12345.psd.  Now they are treated as single images,
	   regardless. Previously, you had to turn off
	   Preferences/Loading/Load Sequence on File Association &
	   CommandLine.
	 - Bug fixed a nasty crash in audio playback, which would appear
	   when switching images, usually in the background.
	 - Improved looping with audio.  No longer audio continues in
	   the background once the last frame is reached.
	 - Bug fixed file requester on multi selections.  Previously,
	   using CTRL or SHIFT to multiselect would, in some cases,
	   not load the files once Okayed.

v3.7.0   - Removed the difference between IPTC and EXIF data, as it was
	   never clear.  Now they are all called Metadata.
	 - Made int attributes' slider in Media Info Window update when
	   changed instead of when released, except for ripmap/mipmap
	   attribute which remains when released.
	 - Added the missing attribute types (matrices, boxes, etc) to
	   RMB->Add->Attributes panel in the Media Info Window.
	 - Bug fixed timecode parsing of drop frame timecode.
	   Valid Examples: 00;01;00;02, 00.01.00.02 or 00:01:00.02.
	 - Added support for multiple video tracks, switching them as
	   you do with subtitles (RMB->Video->Track #).
	 - Added stereo from multiple video tracks in a movie file, when
	   they are the same resolution and have the same frames per
	   second (fps) and duration.  You still need to go to the
	   3D Stereo Window and select the stereo output type.
	 - Bug fixed video/audio/subtitle selection when the codec
	   could not be located.
	 - Added support for OpenEXR's opaque attributes.  They are
	   attributes which cannot be modified.

v3.6.9   - Added saving OpenEXRs with deep data.  Note that this mainly
	   copies the file and changes the metadata only.
	 - mrViewer now retrieves all metadata from an OpenEXR file.
	   Note that except for capDate, all attributes are loaded from
	   the first image in the sequence.
	 - Fixed Preferences->Loading->Auto loading of images when
	   changed on disk. Previously, it was a no-op.  Now it
	   properly updates the changed image(s).
	 - Added an Update Frame in Cache (shortcut 'u') to update
	   only a single frame in the cache.  It reloads the image
	   from disk.
	 - Bug fixed saving of all layers when OpenEXR image had
	   Z and ZBack channels.  Previously, this would crash.
	 - Fixed saving of metadata on OpenEXR images with no layers.
	   Previously, no metadata would get saved.
	 - Fixed a regression which was making loading of multichannel
	   OpenEXR images be too slow to update the display.
	 - Added the ability to create/remove/modify the metadata of
	   a movie or OpenEXR image.  Use the right mouse button on
	   the Media Info Window to get a menu of options.
	 - Removed the saving of dpx:television gamma in dpx saving
	   as it was gamma'ing twice the image.
	 - Made the OpenEXR attribute 'capDate' be stored and update
	   on every frame.
	 - Improved wandImage saving to save all types of attributes
	   in PNG and MIFF formats only.  PSD, TIFF and DPX do not keep
	   the additional attributes.
	 - Note that the current fast PNG reader does not read
	   attributes.
	 - Bug fixed saving of Video attributes in movie files.

v3.6.8   - Made timecode start editable in the Media Info Window.
	   Just type a new timecode and press TAB.
	 - Added creation and removal of IPTC metadata.  In the
	   Media Info Window, use the right mouse button and select
	   Add->IPTC->Metadata or Remove->IPTC->Metadata.
	 - Added creation and removal of EXIF metadata.  In the
	   Media Info Window, use the right mouse button and select
	   Add->EXIF->Metadata or Remove->EXIF->Metadata.
	 - Allowed to load images which have only a number in them,
	   like: 2304.exr.  They are treated as single images, not
	   as sequences.
	 - Bug fixed loading of images that are like: t09.exr, when
	   the image loaded is full content, like: t10.exr.  Now
	   they are both properly recognized as t%02d.exr
	 - Added an option to Preferences->Loading to allow controlling
	   how file asocciations behave when loading a single image
	   or loading it command line.  The option is to load the
	   whole sequence or just the image.  This is similar to
	   the Drag&Drop option in the same Preferences->Loading.
	 - Bug fixed HUD Timecode display.  Previously, the values were
	   wrong.
	 - Bug fixed some memory trashing on the Media Info Window's
	   tooltips.
	 - Bug fixed reading of timecode in OpenEXR pictures.

v3.6.7   - Made timecode be a separate variable, instead of modifying
	   frame directly.  This means:
	      * Frames, Seconds and Time do not take the timecode
		start into account.
	      * Timecode Drop Frame and Timecode Non-Drop Frame take
		timecode start into account.
	 - Bug fixed OpenEXR timecode ( "timeCode" attribute ) to work
	   as said in v3.6.6.
	 - Made playback not start at the point of a preloading cache,
	   but from the cursor location (start of sequence usually).
	 - Bug fixed timecode being incorrect.
	 - Bug fixed Opus audio decoding, which would previously
	   raise tons of errors.

v3.6.6   - Added support for timecode in movies.  When a movie with
	   a header entry of "timecode", or a video stream header entry
	   of "timecode" is found, the timecode is interpreted as an
	   offset of the current frame.
	 - Added support for timecode in OpenEXR pictures.  When the
	   tag "timeCode" is found, the timecode is interpreted.
	 - Added support for m2ts (AVCHD) [Blu Ray] movies.
	 - Added support for saving OpenEXRs with both Z and ZBack
	   channels in a layer.  Previously, the saving would fail.

v3.6.5   - Added tooltips to 3d stereo options panel.
	 - Made VR360 disregard the display window and wrap the
	   data window instead.  Previously, no image was displayed.
	 - Added audio support for playing Dolby TrueHD.
	 - Removed error reporting while creating thumbnails.  This
	   avoids the log window to appear when an error in the thumbnail
	   is found and then not allow closing the log window.

v3.6.4   - Made switching images respect the playback settings.
	   Next Page and Previous Page keys switch images with playback
	   still on.
	 - Bug fixed OpenEXR's framesPerSecond as a string value not
	   respecting the user's locale.  Previously, floating point
	   values with a comma would get turned into floating point
	   values with a period.
	 - Bug fixed opening the viewer in a second monitor through
	   file associations.  Previously, the viewer would not open.

v3.6.3   - Added an Override FPS option to preferences.  With it,
	   you override the FPS of the sequences to that value set in
	   the preferences.  If not active, FPS is tried to be extracted
	   from the image sequence when possible or from the resolution
	   and aspect ratio when not.  Finally, if it all fails, it
	   uses the preferences' FPS setting.
	 - Made framesPerSecond attribute in OpenEXRs be read as a
	   string also, to support Nuke saving it as a string instead of
	   a rational number.  This setting controls FPS when reading
	   OpenEXRs.
	 - Made film.frame_rate and television.frame_rate in DPX files
	   act correctly as a FPS setting.
	 - Made television.gamma in DPX act correctly as a gamma
	   setting.
	 - Fixed cache line for sequences that did not start at 1.
	 - Made FPS 23.976 a default instead of 23.97.

v3.6.2   - Made subtitle always use Arial font by default.
	 - Added selection of font for subtitle in the Preferences.
	   Subtitle->Font.  It is interactive, you can change it while
	   playing the movie.
	 - Made sequence detection more strict by avoiding common movie
	   extensions.

v3.6.1   - Allowed file names like MovieFrame####20.png.
	 - In command line, ILM format (not padded) now correctly sets
	   the start and end frame of sequence.
	   So, for example, avatar.61-120.png will set
	   avatar with a start frame of 61 up to 120.  Note that
	   padding is not supported in ILM format.
	 - Subtitles now work regardless of the location of mrViewer.
	   We change directories before loading a subtitle file.
	 - Embedded subtitles are now loaded automatically.  No
	   need to call Subtitle->Open for them.

v3.6.0   - Allowed image sequences with more than 4 digits in PNGs.
	   Now up to 9 digits are allowed.  Previously, files like:
	   MovieFrame00016.png would get rejected.
	 - Fixed playback of PNGs due to new code seeking incorrectly.
	 - Fixed a crash in Media Information window due to use of
	   an unitialized pointer with PNGs among others.

v3.5.9   - Bug fixed File->Open->Single Image.  It was not doing what
	   it was supposed to do.  Now it loads a single image and
	   the built-in file requester lists sequences as separate
	   images.
	 - Bug fixed translation of Open Single Image as Abrir Imagen.
	   Previously it would say Grabar Imagen.
	 - Bug fixed yellow line in file requester to always redraw
	   properly and not leave a half line drawn.
	 - Made thumbnail picture never exceed 150 pixels in width.

v3.5.8   - Bug fixed preload cache of PNGs to do nothing like movie
	   files.  This fixes loading of PNGs when they don't begin at
	   frame 1.
	 - Bug fixed a crash when a single PNG was attempted to be
	   loaded.  It would raise a floating point exception.
	 - Bug fixed listing and loading frames with no dots as possible
	   frame spec ( %, d, l ) as image sequences.  For example,
	   ballred.png.  Now the check is more rigorous and they are
	   treated as single images.

v3.5.7   - ** IMPORTANT BUG FIX **  Fixes preloading of image sequences,
	   which would crash v3.5.6 due to a debugging abort().
	   Regression.
	 - Added missing ffmpeg utilities to win32.
	 - Added missing exr utilities to win32/win64.

v3.5.6   - Made ogg and ogv be valid movie extensions.
	 - Improved the FFMPEG PNG reader to allow it to start at
	   any frame in the sequence.
	 - Made the FFMPEG PNG reader the default one.  This makes
	   reading PNGs about five (5x) times faster.

v3.5.5   - Made YUV Conversion preference actually work correctly.
	   Now it sets the color space index upon loading of the movie.
	   You can now still change it afterwards manually in the
	   Media Information Window->Color Space.
	 - Changed algorithm to position window when first opened.
	   This keeps window on the Desktop and clips centered.
	   It helps when window would span two monitors.
	 - Consolidated not finding and loading of images in sequences.
	   Previously, this could crash the viewer when creating the
	   icons.
	 - **IMPORTANT** Moved VR360 channel layer from the channel
	   pulldown as a button in 3D Stereo Window .  This allows
	   putting any layer in 360, not just the color layer.
	 - Made caching of sequences independent of VR 360.
	   Previously, VR 360 would get deactivated for caching images.
	 - Added a menu and hotkey (ctrl+h) to toggle the hud display.
	 - Removed toggle all hud as it is quite useless.
	 - Bug fixed LUT turning itself off when switching to VR 360.
	 - Made HUD Resolution always display DAW (Data Window) and
	   DYW (Display Window).  Previously, when both were equal
	   only a single line -RES (Resolution)- was displayed.
	 - Added an environment variable ( USE_FFMPEG_PNG ) to switch
	   PNG reader to that of FFMPEG.  The FFMPEG reader is faster
	   and works like a movie file, but it fails when there are
	   gaps in the sequence of frames and it always requires the
	   sequence to start at frame 1.
	 - Made HUD display in VR 360 mode.

v3.5.4   - Restored sRGBColorspace hint as it was not the cause
	   of double gamma.  It is a bug with Windows' photo
	   app.
	 - Allowed sequences without first periods, like:
		   image0001.pic
	   instead of image.0001.pic or image_0001.pic
	 - Improved window positioning when image is too large.
	   Previously, the borders would be placed outside the
	   desktop.
	 - Bug fixed VR 360 which had clipping planes too close
	   to the enclosing sphere and could run into floating
	   point errors ( leading to a cut off sphere ).
	 - Added zooming into the VR 360 view with mousewheel
	   or ALT+RMB.  The zooming is always done on the
	   center of the screen.  Not where the mouse is.
	 - In VR, 'f' key will reset the view angle to 45 degrees.
	 - In VR, 'h' key will center the rotation the view at 0
	   degrees in X and Y.
	 - Added name of maintainer in DEB file.
	 - Made postrm and posinst scripts in DEB file be 0755
	   permissions.

v3.5.3   - Using a single instance of mrViewer was not removing
	   the mrViewer.lock.prefs file.  Fixed.
	 - OpenGL was crashing the program on loading an image
	   when the graphics card was not an NVidia card.
	   Fixed.
	 - Removed sRGBColorspace hint from wandImage creator
	   (png, tiffs, etc), as it was leading to two gamma
	   corrections in other programs.

v3.5.2   - Fixed a bug of NAN values in the 3dl2ctl.rb converter
	   when 3d lut was a set of values up to 1023 or less.
	   Now the script properly auto detects the depth to use.
	 - Added support for 1D luts in cube2ctl.rb.  Previously
	   only the 3d lut format was supported.
	 - Fixed a crashing bug in audio display when audio was
	   short.
	 - Fixed HUD display of resolution when exr had crop
	   areas.
	 - Added a View->Hud->All to toggle on/off all hud settings.
	 - Made scrubbing be more sensitive to drag. This allows
	   viewing more frames before reseting the scrub with CTRL.
	 - Added a new Preference setting:
		 Playback->Defaults->Scrubbing Sensitivity
	   which controls the speed of scrubbing when moving the
	   mouse right and left after SHIFT clicking.
	   The new setting is 4 times more sensitive than what
	   was there before.
	 - Reverted back the swizzling of channels on 5.1 or higher
	   as it was leading to very quiet dialogues.
	 - Fixed a huge memory leak when working with sequences.
	   Deleting them from the reel was not clearing all memory.
	 - Bug fixed requester in media browser asking if image is
	   to be removed when the reel is empty.

v3.5.1   - Fixed a memory leak in OpenEXR library.
	 - Fixed a memory leak in audio buffer.
	 - Made CTL listing list all ctl scripts alphabetically,
	   regardless of what directory they are in.  Previously,
	   each directory would list its files alphabetically.
	   Also, repeated CTL scripts are avoided.
	 - Added a preference to the Video section to set the YUV
	   Colorspace conversion to something consistant (BT709,
	   Unspecified, BT470BG, etc) instead of reading the
	   information from the movie file.
	 - CTL browser now has an Empty button to select an
	   empty CTL (clear it).  Previously you had to open the
	   requester to click on an empty area.
	 - Added a Ruby command-line script that converts .3dl lut
	   (as created by Nuke) into a (LMT) CTL script. The script
	   is called 3dl2ctl.rb and is in the bin/ directory of the
	   distribution.
	 - Added a Ruby command-line script that converts .cube lut
	   (as created by Iridas and Adobe) into a (LMT) CTL script.
	   The script is called cube2ctl.rb and is in the bin/
	   directory of the distribution.

v3.5.0   - There was a bug in the theme color selection which would
	   show as random crashes on Windows, particularly when the
	   viewer was in the background.  Fixed.

v3.4.9   - Added an option in Preferences to select the number of
	   fstops the LUT will use.  This helps to get more accurate
	   values on black levels.
	 - On Windows, turning on the LUT automatically was not
	   showing the results immediately.  Fixed.

v3.4.8   - Added LUT SOP and Saturation nodes to cover ASC_CDL.
	 - Added GUI SOP and Saturation to modify the ASC_CDL of
	   ACESclip files.
	 - Made GUI SOP and Saturation add 4 look mod transforms if
	   not present:
	   ACEScsc.ACES_to_ACEScg -> LMT.SOPNode ->
		      LMT.SatNode -> ACEScsc.ACEScg_to_ACES
	 - Made GUI SOP and Saturation turn on LUT automatically.
	 - Made OpenGL use any fixed text if no font of 16 pixels is
	   found.
	 - Added HUD display of directory which was missing.
	 - Removed libfontconfig.so.1 from Linux distribution as it
	   should use the one installed in the machine OS.
	 - Added "Values" button to change values of SOP and Saturation
	   in the Media Information window.
	 - Made CTL Preferences not reset the LUT button, but activate
	   it if it is not on and the preference is set to have it on.
	 - Bug fixed stereo exr layer selection when images in sequence
	   change the order or count of layer pairs.  Note that you
	   cannot expect an image to have layer.rgbaz and the next
	   have layer.rgba and layer.z.  Only the rgba will be taken
	   into account in that case.
	 - Extracted duration of movies from the movie stream instead
	   of the file context.  This leads to better calculation of
	   end frame.

v3.4.7   - Made CTL Lut baking calculation faster and more accurate.
	 - Made CTL/ICC of monitor trigger a refresh of the view.
	   Previously, the old values were kept until a refresh from
	   other ways happened (switch to new frame, etc).
	 - Removed a debugging statement in the seek request.
	 - Bug fixed ImageMagick loader to work with different color
	   spaces.  This effects log colorspace as found in DPX images.
	   Previously rgb layers would not appear and only VR360 would
	   show up.
	 - Added all ACES v1.0.3 CTL transforms.
	 - Made CTL browser list all transforms sorted alphabetically.
	 - Allowed CTL transform which is only the prefix, like RRT.ctl.
	   Previously those file names would not get shown.
	 - Added missing CTL scripts ( LMT.SatNode and LMT.SOPNode )
	   used to emulate ASC_CDL.
	 - Compiled libtiff into ImageMagick which was missing in the
	   previous release on Linux.
	 - Removed the auto maximize window on Linux as it was buggy.
	   Now it works like Windows.

v3.4.6   - Made mrViewer compile with Linux 3.13.0-32 (Ubuntu 12.04.5).
	 - Fixed chocolatey uninstaller to remove the directory of
	   the mrViewer install.
	 - Fixed glsl shaders to compile under NVidia's old drivers.
	 - Added FONTCONFIG_PATH to mrViewer.sh to remove warnings of
	   fontconfig. Commented out as, supposedly, unneeded.
	 - Fixed LUT crashes due to new stereo engine OpenGL
	   conflicts.
	 - Fixed saving of ACESclip XML files only, on Linux.

v3.4.5   - Bug fixed GIF duration check, which would result in errors
	   due to ffmpeg new api.  Regression from v3.4.1.
	 - Bug fixed saving of reels from the gui on Windows.
	   Previously this led to a crash due to libintl conflicting
	   with Windows' stdio.
	 - Bug fixed audio device descriptor count as it seems Windows
	   or its drivers impose a limit on the number of open devices.
	   This prevented audio to be played on the 8th clip or so.
	 - Made 5.1/7.1 Surround not shuffle channels as they now seem
	   to come ordered from ffmpeg.
	 - Added input of , to float input requesters to support Spanish
	   locale on Windows.

v3.4.4   - Bug fixed stuterring NaNs in pixel info bar when loading
	   an OpenEXR sequence.  This was particularly buggy on Windows.
	 - Fixed documentation, main_toolbar.html, to reflect the
	   changes in stereo.
	 - Fixed a playback bug which would stop playback sooner than at
	   the end.  In some cases, video playback would not even begin.
	 - Fixed video frames at the end of movies not being shown.
	 - Added Disposition to the video, audio and subtitle tracks'
	   media info.
	 - Lowered the severity of errors caused by missing frames.  Now
	   they are warnings instead of errors.
	 - Bug fixed audio frames on right eye movies at the beginning.
	 - Bug fixed a problem with multiple images when not in EDL mode
	   which would lead to stopping and switching to the wrong
	   image.
	 - Bug fixed stepping on the second/third/etc. movie in a reel.

v3.4.3   - Bug fixed VR360 on network communication not always opening
	   in the VR360 view.
	 - Bug fixed a dead lock of log window due to multiple threads
	   accessing it when in stereo.  The problem would show up
	   in Linux, mainly.
	 - Bug fixed normalized pixel values when in some stereo mode,
	   like Red/Cyan glasses.
	 - Allowed graphics cards with small textures display videos
	   thru scaling down the original video.
	 - Bug fixed crash of switching to an empty reel when
	   background image was active.
	 - Bug fixed background image being shifted by start frame
	   when not in EDL mode.
	 - Bug fixed stereo of Z (depth) channels in stereo OpenEXRs
	   with multipart files.
	   Previously only one channel would be shown or multiple
	   errors would show up if the deepest Z channel was chosen.
	 - Fixed a bug where background images would not appear once
	   they were offset in the EDL.
	 - Fixed error reporting with frame number to report the
	   actual frame, not one before.
	 - Improved synchronism of background images/movies with
	   foreground sequences.
	 - Made looping not effect every image in a reel, only the
	   foreground image.
	 - Made VR 360 dragging stop after a while.  This makes it
	   easier to control.
	 - Fixed stepping on background images when they are in the
	   same reel as the foreground image.
	 - Fixed compositing of foreground images on background
	   movies due to an overflow in calculations.  Now the values
	   are clamped to prevent the error, which showed up on
	   Windows only.

v3.4.2   - Added Paint Tools to the Preferences so it can be opened
	   on startup.
	 - Bug fixed color area of bottom/top and right/left on
	   stereo output.
	 - Bug fixed a wrong memory access due to a race condition
	   on a missing mutex.
	   This bug would often show up as a crash in stereo reels.
	 - Fixed a bug that would crash the viewer when selecting
	   stereo viewing and no image was present on the right eye.
	 - Allowed fit image to fit the right image only when it is
	   selected in the stereo options window.
	 - Allowed gamma control on each stereo image when two
	   sequences or movies are fed.
	   If both images are shown, both images change gamma.
	   If only one image is shown, only that image will change
	   gamma.
	   Note that for stereo OpenEXRs (sxr) or Top/Bottom or
	   Left/Right inputs, both images change gamma always.
	 - Updated log window so it appears as soon as an error is
	   raised (and the Preferences' option is set to such).
	   Previously, the mouse had to be moving or the movie had
	   to be playing.
	 - Made normalize pixel values (Norm button) be displayed
	   in pixel bar and in color area, vectorscope and histogram.
	 - Added Stereo 3D Options window and Paint Tools Window to those
	   that get hidden on presentation mode (F12 key).  Previously
	   it would leave the main window in full screen mode only
	   with OS's toolbars open.
	 - Made Stereo Options Window and Paint Tools Window appear/
	   disappear on network connections.
	 - Made Stereo OpenGL active on card capability albeit it has
	   not been tested.
	 - Made stereo input and output work in network connections.
	 - Bug fixed network connections on different locale (Spanish).
	 - Removed language selection from the interface.  Now all
	   is controlled with the environment variable LC_ALL.
	 - Bug fixed network connections which were severely broken.
	   Now they shouldn't crash and reconnects should be possible.
	 - Added VR 360 to network connections.

v3.4.1   - Improved the cache saving with stereo sequences.
	 - Bug fixed thumbnail creation for sequences with varying
	   data windows.
	 - Made stereo 3D cache line in the timeline be bright green.
	   For non stereo caches, the line remains dark green.
	 - Bug fixed some movies not showing the last frames of
	   the film on playback.
	 - Bug fixed stereo input on images with display windows
	   (OpenEXRs).  Now selecting stereo input Top/Bottom will
	   correctly split the image in half to use the top as the
	   left eye and the bottom as the right eye (or viceversa
	   according to stereo output).
	   Using stereo input top/bottom or left/right on images
	   with different data windows will not work well.
	 - Made main window appear maximized on startup when showing
	   some large video or image (Linux only). This works very
	   nice in Ubuntu's Unity.
	 - Fixed pixel queries on all stereo input/output states.
	   Previously the pixel shown could be wrong or point to
	   undefined memory (leading to potential crashes).
	 - Made stereo output changes not clear caches on movies.
	   This removes warnings and errors that would happen
	   otherwise if the movie was in playback.
	 - Added Stereo 3D Options Window to preferences, so the
	   window can be shown on starting up mrViewer.
	 - Bug fixed color info rectangle to reach the ends of the
	   image when the image has a data window.
	 - Bug fixed color info rectangle to work properly on stereo
	   displays (left/right, top/bottom, interlaced, etc).
	 - Bug fixed a bug when typing a speed of fps which could
	   hang the viewer.
	 - Added documentation for Stereo 3D Options.

v3.4.0   - Bug fixed cache saving for image sequences.  Regression
	   from v3.3.9.
	 - Made Stereo Window settings be persistent when loading
	   new images.

v3.3.9   - Made VR 360 channel appear only once.  Previously, when
	   switching resolutions of a multiresolution image, several
	   VR 360 channels would appear.
	 - Made int slider in Image Information update on release,
	   instead of on value change.  This makes it behave more
	   nicely with mipmaps and ripmaps.
	 - Fixed image coordinates when data window is smaller than
	   display window.  Previously there would be an offset.
	 - Added new 3D Stereo Options panel.  This panel allows selecting
	   the input and output options of stereo images.  It allows
	   you to show in stereo any group of left/right paired channels
	   in OpenEXRs, instead of just the beauty channels as before.
	   It also allows selecting input of images which have the two
	   stereo channels in them by selecting top-bottom or left-right.
	   This type of movies is typical of youtube.
	   You can also mix this with VR360 for a virtual reality 3D
	   stereo movie.
	 - Removed old stereo channels from the channels pulldown.  Use
	   the new stereo options window for controlling 3D stereo.
	 - Fixed image coordinates and color information on cursor
	   position when in 3D stereo mode.
	 - Fixed left and right image sometimes showing up in reverse.
	 - Made fit image when changing stereo output.
	 - Bug fixed a memory leak when exiting.

v3.3.8   - Added VR 360 support for environment maps and VR videos.
	   Images or Videos whose width is twice the height will show
	   a VR 360 channel in the channel pop up and also those with
	   less than 6 channels.
	   When in VR 360° mode, dragging the mouse with the left
	   mouse button (or the middle mouse button) will orient you
	   around and up and down.
	   The resolution supported is the maximum supported by your
	   graphics card ( See About/HW ).  On relatively new graphics
	   cards, the maximum resolution is 16384x16384.
	   Note that 3D VR 360 is currently unsupported.
	 - Documented VR support in the Main Toolbar section of the
	   html docs.
	 - Added a video with the VR 360 workflow
	   https://youtu.be/hihPKB8En7c     - VR360 workflow
	 - Removed an error display in preferences wizard selection when
	   no item is selected.

v3.3.7   - Fixed cache line in timeline for sequences which would
	   show only the cache from frame forwards.
	   Regression from v3.3.6.
	 - Bug fixed a crash in Drag and Drop when several reels were
	   loaded.
	 - On Windows fixed the volume indicator which would show only
	   half the volume.
	 - Bug fixed audio volume control on Linux.
	 - Removed empty filename from drag and drop on Linux.
	 - Made queue size bigger to handle some movies
	   (Abba_Chiquitita_Español.wmv )

v3.3.6   - Bug fixed EDL playback which got broken in v3.3.5.
	 - Minimized (fixed) hangings and crashings due to log window.
	 - Made audio track selection in EDL control all clips of EDL.
	 - Made Timebar Looping control in EDL control the looping
	   of all clips in EDL.
	 - Fixed cache line to not extend beyond the start of clips.

v3.3.5   - Made loop mode be an attribute of the movie or sequence
	   loaded instead of the timeline.
	   It is now possible, for example, to have a foreground
	   sequence with loop on and a background movie with swing
	   (ping pong) on.
	 - Allowed image sequences to extend beyond their natural
	   image boundaries.  The behavior is controlled by the
	   loop mode.  If a sequence of 100 frames is played for
	   200 frames, the end behavior of the sequence will be to
	   stop, loop or ping pong as set accordingly.
	   Note that this feature does not yet work with videos or
	   with sequences with audio attached.
	 - Added the -b flag to the command line to load a sequence
	   or a movie in the background of the view window.
	 - Made reloading of images work for images in the background
	   of the view window.
	 - Bug fixed a problem in ping pong playback of some short
	   movie files.
	 - Bug fixed stepping a frame and changing movie files in EDL
	   mode as it would sometimes not revert it to the actual frame
	   needed.
	 - Bug fixed playback of some movies with audio in EDL.
	   Previously, some frames would get skipped.
	 - Removed a hanging bug which would happen if step frame was
	   set on continuosly while the movie played.

v3.3.4   - Bug fixed reloading of images from disk when the creation
	   or modification time changed and the image is not complete.
	   You will get an error when loading the image, but it will
	   get loaded if tried on a second attempt (when it has
	   finished being saved).
	   Previously, the image would not get loaded on a second
	   attempt.
	 - Made loop mode be an attribute of the movie or sequence
	   loaded.  It is now possible to have a foreground sequence
	   with loop on and a background movie with ping pong on.

v3.3.3   - Audio volume is no longer set at start up unless the
	   value the Preferences->Override Audio is set.  This
	   allows you to control the volume from the system's
	   preferences (gnome-control-center, for example)
	 - Images (not movies) saved on disk can now be updated and
	   the viewer will refresh the image by itself.  You
	   need to check the option in the "Preferences->Loading->
	   Auto update images when changed on disk"
	 - Made exit of playback more solid when there are errors
	   and the error window is up.
	 - Made the error of a missing frame in the sequence be a
	   warning instead.

v3.3.2   - Bug fixed file requester closing after typing a filename
	   and choosing a button other than OK or Cancel.
	 - Bug fixed file requester not accepting list of images
	   in the form of %04d.  This was a problem introduced
	   in v3.3.1.
	 - Bug fixed thread hanging in decode thread when audio was
	   on in a sequence of frames.
	 - Bug fixed name of movie files saving when in EDL mode.
	   Previously, a number suffix was always added.  Now,
	   only when more than a single movie is saved the suffix
	   is added.

v3.3.1   - Bug fixed window fullscreen and presentation on Linux
	   Ubuntu's Gnome Unity, which would lock the windows in
	   fullscreen mode.  This was not a problem with KDE.
	   We apologize for letting this bug remain so long.
	 - Allowed selection of Favorites, Desktop, My Computer
	   and Documents from the input browser pulldown on
	   Windows.

v3.3.0   - Bug fixed gif sequence detection.  Now mrViewer can
	   load both single animated gifs as well as a sequence of
	   gif files, as those generated by default in Maya's
	   playblast.
	 - Added Softimage .pic (si in maya) loader and saver.
	 - Bug fixed a crash that could happen when an image was
	   not loaded.

v3.2.9   - It is now possible to switch audio device in the
	   Preferences window, Audio section on Windows.
	   For Linux, the preferred way is to leave the
	   setting as default and use the default system
	   audio control (gnome-control-center).
	   By default, the system default audio device is used.
	 - In Windows, UNC network paths are now accepted.
	   For example:
	       //gga-desktop1/D/movies/test.mov
	   They can be used from Drag and Drop.  Currently,
	   it is not possible to type or pick them in yourself.

v3.2.8   - Fixed playback being too fast on 4K video
	   (Disney's Moana Trailer).
	 - Fixed video stores being kept too long and eating ton
	   of memory.  This improves playback of long movies and
	   4K movies.  On Win32 when playing 4K movies, it may
	   be needed to size the cache smaller.
	 - Upgraded Windows compiling to MSVC 2015 Community on
	   x64.  Win32 uses the MSVC 2012 compiler.
	   This potentially removes Windows NT and XP compatability.
	 - When mrViewer runs out of memory it will print an error
	   into its message console, instead of crashing.
	 - Bug fixed scrubbing on Windows 8.1.
	   It works as a toggle now.  You press SHIFT and enter
	   scrub mode.  Move the mouse left and right.
	   You press CTRL and exit scrub mode.
	   If you have preferences (.filmaura/mrViewer.prefs) saved,
	   no change in scrubbing is made.
	   If you want the new scrubbing, Untoggle Shift button and
	   leave hotkey1 to LeftShift and hotkey2 to RightShift in
	   the Hotkeys selection window for Scrubbing.

v3.2.7   - Updated Histogram in RGB to show colors mixed in areas
	   where R, G and B overlap.  So you get R+G=YELLOW,
	   G+B=CYAN, R+B=MAGENTA, R+G+B=WHITE.
	 - Bug fixed histogram so R,G,B are averaged with the
	   same maximum value.
	   Previously, each channel was averaged individually,
	   leading to overshooting of histogram.
	 - Made audio offset in EDL window shift in opposite
	   direction as it is more intuitive.
	 - Audio offset no longer effects other videos in the
	   timeline.

v3.2.6   - Audio offset was conflicting with audio loop.  This
	   got broken in v3.2.3.  Fixed.
	 - Bug fixed an audio store problem that would remove needed
	   audio frames.  See Matrix_Reloaded_Trailer.mkv.
	 - Removed libdl and libpthreads from Linux distribution as
	   that made them less compatible with current distros.

v3.2.5   - Bug fix release to address the saving of images with
	   an audio track added.  This got broken in v3.2.4.

v3.2.4   - Added shift audio offset to server-client communication.
	 - Added an Override FPS setting to the Save Movie requester
	   to simplify where FPS for saving movies is set.
	 - Bug fixed audio video sync playback for some movies.
	   (See Babalar.mp4 sample).  This change fixes audio
	   stores, too.
	 - Bug fixed saving of some movies that would result in
	   mixed frames.
	 - Made audio offset work in network connections.

v3.2.3   - Audio offsets play nicely with EDL now.
	 - There's a new audio track below the video track in the
	   EDL Window.  It reports the audio offset which can be
	   shifted by RMB+drag on the audio line.  This is
	   equivalent to setting the offset from the menus
	   ( Audio->Edit Audio Frame Offset ).
	 - Avoided a crash in EDL when shifting to a missing frame.
	 - Made EDL play correctly when audio offset is different
	   than 0.
	 - Shifting (RMB+drag) of clips in EDL now shows the frame
	   being displayed.

v3.2.2   - GIFs now return their proper duration, instead of 200
	   frames.
	 - Saving of images with audio added now works again.
	   Audio offset now works without speeding up the image or
	   jumping frames.
	   This bug is a regression from v3.1.0 when it was
	   introduced.
	 - Audio offset now works forwards and backwards (negative
	   values).

v3.2.1   - Presentation Mode (F12) now covers the taskbar on Linux,
	   just like Windows.
	 - Removed idle workaround for Windows as it was not needed.
	   Now the pixel toolbar respects the position of the
	   cursor in playback mode.
	 - Bug fixed dummy errors at the end of clips when in
	   EDL mode.
	 - Made Log Window show up on Errors on Windows based on
	   user preferences.  Previously, it would hang the GUI.

v3.2.0   - Thumbnails in file requester are created with the audio
	   off.  This makes thumbnails a tad faster.
	 - Thumbnails in file requester now select frame in 1/4 of
	   the movie to create the thumbnail.  This means thumbnail
	   creation is slower but more representative of the movie.
	 - Made fullscreen in presentation mode (F12) cover all the
	   screen space in Windows, instead of leaving 5 pixels
	   visible at the bottom.
	 - Log Window now displays always the bottom of the log so
	   that it can be read properly on playback.
	 - Bug fixed audio playback when changing fps on Linux.
	   Previously, it would change the format of the audio and
	   result in white noise.
	 - Bug fixed changing from Native locale to C locale on
	   Linux.
	 - Bug fixed volume control on Windows which would sometimes
	   play the audio in mono.  Previous fix was incorrect.

v3.1.9   **NOTE** If using the Windows installer, it is
		  recommended you uninstall v3.1.8 before
		  installing v3.1.9.
	 - Fixed multithreading issues in file requester.  It should
	   not crash anymore.
	 - Added an option in main UI preferences to select what
	   language the UI works in.  Currently, the options are
	   Native (as in Native to the OS) or English.  Currently
	   only Spanish and English are fully supported.
	 - Updated the English and Spanish documentation.
	 - Fixed level queries of OpenEXR's mipmaps and ripmaps.
	   Previously the image was not refreshed properly.
	 - Made Windows Installer ask if you want to remove a
	   previous version of the software first.  This should
	   work with this version on of the program.
	 - Made Windows Installer provide a GUI at the end to
	   select which file extensions get associated with
	   mrViewer.  The association is with the mrViewer
	   installed last.
	 - Added libswscale and libavfilter versions to
	   About mrViewer.
	 - About mrViewer now reports 32-bits or 64-bits mrViewer
	   (compilation).

v3.1.8   - Removed a buggy fltk::unlock() that could cause
	   inestability in the file requester.
	 - Fixed some compilation issues and upgraded all cmake to
	   latest version.  This was probably the fix to the audio
	   playing in mono only.
	 - Fixed cmake scripts to use WIN64 correctly.
	 - Removed debugging message when switching subtitle tracks.
	 - Bug fixed surround sound on Windows when 4 channels are
	   in the audio track.
	 - Made selecting no subtitle in the file requester not
	   effect on subtitle track display.
	 - Cleaned up docs/ directory which was full of unrelated
	   technical documents.
	 - Added more Spanish translations.
	 - Made file size report in file requester support more than
	   4GB on Windows.
	 - mrViewer on Windows now correctly reports multilingual
	   (utf8) filenames' size.
	 - Fixed warning of smpteImage not being aligned on 16 bits
	   boundaries for Windows 32 bits.
	 - Windows installer will now register most of the file
	   extensions with the latest installed mrViewer.  Extensions
	   which belong to editing programs (PSD, etc) are not
	   registered.  This is somewhat controversial, so we expect
	   feedback if users don't like the registry entries.
	 - Created the web page for mrviewer at
	   mrviewer.sourceforge.net.  Also, uploaded the latest
	   manual to the web.

v3.1.7   - Made MPEG4 profiles choose more sensible ones.
	 - Fixed typo in ITU 709 being called ITU 702 in Spanish.
	 - Bug fixed display of duration and start frame of videos
	   and audios in Media Information Window.
	 - Bug fixed duration extraction for video/audio tabs in
	   Media Information Window.
	 - Added YUV Hint to the saving of movie files.  This setting
	   can be set to control the Color Space in the Media Info
	   Window when the movie is loaded back.  The setting
	   controls how the YUV->RGB display conversion is done.
	   For HDTV movies, it is recommended you set the setting to
	   BT709.  For others, it is recommended you set the setting
	   to BT470BG (PAL/Secam) or SMPTE170M (NTSC).
	 - Added tooltips to all settings in the Save Movie dialog
	   box.
	 - Bug fixed a memory leak in subtitles when stopping
	   playback.
	 - Added subtitles in different files ( .srt, .sub, .ass ).
	 - Bug fixed Windows audio playback playing only in mono.
	   Now stereo and 5:1 is respected.  The problem seemed to
	   be the cmake compilation.  Upgrading to latest cmake
	   seemed to fix the issue.

v3.1.6   - Bug fixed an error in shaders when playing a YCrCb or
	   YByRy movie or sequence.  The error would show in debug
	   builds of mrViewer, as an assert failing due to unpremult
	   missing in shader.
	 - File requester now opens on the last directory of any
	   drag and drop file.
	 - Fixed a rare hanging bug when multiselecting files in the
	   file requester.
	 - Shader's YUV display conversion is no longer YCbCr based
	   on resolution but covers the full gamut of Y.
	   The type of YUV display conversion is controlled from the
	   Media Information window, Color Space enum, which in turn
	   can be hinted in the saved movie file.
	   To obtain the previous behavior, set the Color Space to
	   BT709.  This addresses the question why movie files
	   created and displayed with mrViewer had a high black
	   pedestal (they were displayed as BT709).
	   Note that this does not currently change the values of
	   pixels in the pixel info toolbar nor in the color area
	   window.

v3.1.5   - Bug fixed focus (hotkeys not working) when loading and
	   resizing window (a bug introduced in v3.1.4 on Windows
	   mainly).
	 - Bug fixed some exif and iptc metadata that was not kept in
	   OpenEXR saver.
	 - Bug fixed creation date information on sequences of images.
	 - Removed a warning about stereo images not being found in
	   an image when stereo came from two image pairs.
	 - Bug fixed a NAN display of pixel values when they were 0, due
	   to a bad optimization added in v3.1.4.
	 - Made integer slider grow to accomodate values below the 100
	   range in Media Information window.

v3.1.4   - Bug fixed windows preference of child windows (Reel List, etc),
	   appearing at the beginning under the main window.  Now they
	   appear above and don't go behind the main window when not
	   selected.
	 - Bug fixed network communication crashes due to server
	   running in a different thread than the gfx toolkit.  Now
	   the network thread sends signals to the gfx toolkit, instead
	   of trying to apply the change in the same thread.
	 - Bug fixed None audio codec in audio saving in Spanish to Ninguno.
	 - Made default saver h264, with High profile.
	 - Made conversion to 16 bits from float/half images 10% faster.
	 - Bug fixed a display bug in the browser in the media info window
	   when you clicked and "opened" a category.
	 - Bug fixed a crash when audio could not be initialized.
	 - Localized all audio messages.  Added Spanish translation.
	 - Bug fixed Connections' Create button in Spanish locale.
	 - Bug fixed audio muting when not saving with audio in Spanish
	   locale.
	 - Bug fixed memory and disk space reports in media info.
	 - Made Reel List save image button save sequences or movie files
	   instead of a single picture.

v3.1.3   - Made mousewheel on Windows work when multiple screens are
	   used.  This might fix ticket #21 (mousewheel not working).
	 - Bug fixed scrollbar in file requester when set to wide view.
	 - Added some missing Spanish translations.
	 - Removing a reel or removing an image now present a requester
	   for confirmation.
	 - Added support for ProRes movie creation.  The movies are
	   created with yuv420p10 color information from 16-bits images.
	   Half and Float images are translated to 16-bits first
	   taking gamma into account and then encoded.
	 - Added a profile option to movie saving.  This allows selecting
	   the algorithms for compatability with other movie software.
	 - Added an alert and abort to saving over the same movie you are
	   playing.

v3.1.2   - Made file requester leave headroom for icons on images and
	   movies.  This avoids the resizing of the scrollbar each
	   time a movie icon is created.
	 - Made name of movie or sequence not overlap type, but use
	   ..., like "batman-vs-superm..."
	 - Made icon creation in file requester faster.
	 - Made the file requester not reset its position as images
	   appear.
	 - Made the file requester reset its position on dir change.
	 - Made transcoding of movie files much faster and creation of
	   movie files from 8 or 16 bits images, too.
	 - Added partial support for ProRes, but did not expose it in
	   the GUI as it does not support half or float datatypes yet.

v3.1.1   - Relaxed the minimum zoom factor to 1/64 or less.  This allows
	   displaying 16K images properly if the card allows it.
	 - Transcoding movie files now keeps video and audio metadata,
	   like timecode string.
	 - Fixed a crash in EDL editing which would happen when modifying
	   the lengths of the clips.
	 - Images bigger than gfx card texture size will print a warning
	   and be drawn as before with a buggy scanline algorithm which
	   does not support gamma or gain changes.
	 - Added support for reading MXF and Avid DNxHD in mov container.

v3.1.0   - Fixed "export PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC" on Linux to avoid audio
	   underruns, which would lead to garbled audio.
	 - Made Scrubbing hotkey take effect. Previously, the use of
	   shift dragging was locked.
	 - Added acesImageContainerFlag set to 1 to exr files saved
	   with ACES clip metadata sidecar with them.
	 - Bug fixed data/display window on PSD files being offset by
	   1 pixel.
	 - Updated media information window on channel change.
	 - Bug fixed a crash on exr saving with channels with same
	   prefix.
	 - Updated ffmpeg.exe and other utilities to use latest
	   libraries (avcodec-57.dll, etc).
	 - Reworked the video-audio sync a little.  It is much
	   better on Windows now.
	 - Removed Q16 ImageMagick libraries from linux distro.

v3.0.9   - Tested PSD saver with Photoshop 2015 and added changes so
	   main Color layer appears.  Previously, Photoshop would
	   swallow it without a warning.
	 - Canvas is now set up properly in the PSD saver.
	 - Moved to ImageMagick 6.9.3-0 which improves PSD/TIFF saver
	   a tad.
	 - Tested under Krita and GIMP and all works well.  Photoshop
	   CS 2015 (Trial) shows white areas outside data window when
	   it is smaller than the display window.  Not sure why.
	 - Bug fixed channel selection in PSD files.  Previously,
	   switching from main Color channel to an R,G, or B channel
	   in another layer, would not update properly.
	 - Bug fixed a crash in file requester when
	   icons were being created and user selected the favorites
	   button or changed directories.  Now the running icon
	   finishes and then the list of favorites or other directory
	   appears.

v3.0.8   - Bug fixed ImageMagick saver to work with PSD multilayer files.
	   It is now possible to take an openexr multi part file and turn
	   it into a Photoshop file.  Note that this needs more testing
	   and feedback.
	 - Consolidated Favorites paths preferences to be stored under
	   $HOME/.filmaura instead of $HOME/.fltk/filmaura.  You should
	   move your favorite list accordingly.
	 - Added Memory Display to HUD.  It displays physical used memory
	   over total physical memory and virtual used memory over total
	   virtual memory.
	 - Fixed a bunch of bugs related to out of bounds memory accesses
	   and undefined variables.  This makes viewer less prone to
	   hanging or crashing.
	 - Extended 8-bit caching and scaling to stereo caches.
	 - Added support to Adobe's DNG format thru the ufraw-batch
	   standalone utility.  You need to install it manually in a
	   place mrViewer can reach (somewhere in your PATH). On Linux,
	   this just means downloading it with your packet manager, like:

	   $ sudo apt-get install ufraw-batch

	 - Bug fixed audio garbling on Linux once an underrun occurred.
	 - Bug fixed cache line to not show images cached past the video
	   length.

v3.0.7   - Bug fixed OpenEXR loader loading the wrong channels in
	   animation when image was a multipart image.  This could
	   happen if you selected the Color channel and then selected an
	   R, G or B channel from another layer.  The image(s) would not
	   get updated.
	 - Added OpenEXR preference defaults.  These include:  number of
	   threads to use when loading files (4 by default),
	   compression algorithm to use when saving files (PIZ by default)
	   and DWA compression value (45 by default) for
	   DWA/DWB compression.
	 - Added hotkeys for travelling the channels.  By default the
	   next channel hotkey is } and the previous one is {.
	 - Improved OpenEXR loader to use less memory on RGB only images
	   and layers.  Previously, they were stored in memory as RGBA,
	   with an empty alpha mask.
	 - Bug fixed OpenEXR's multiview images when in stereo mode.  Only
	   left stereo was used.  This bug was introduced in v3.0.6.
	 - Bug fixed the caching of multipart images.  Previously,
	   switching from, say, diffuse.diffuse.R to diffuse
	   would trigger the clearing of the cache.  Now the cache is kept.

v3.0.6   - Made OpenEXR saver work with YByRy images.
	 - Bug fixed loading of YByRy images to display By or Ry layers.
	 - Improved OpenEXR loader to recognize multi part stereo images as
	   saved by the saver.
	 - Removed black frames when loading a sequence for the first time
	   (before the cache).
	 - Bug fixed OpenEXR saver when the source was a movie file.
	 - Added all layers saving to image magick saver.  This works with
	   TIFFs mostly, albeit somewhat buggy (positions of layers are
	   not kept).

v3.0.5   - Made PSD, XCF and TIFF reader read the position and bounding
	   box of layers correctly.
	 - Made ICC Profiles not crash on embeded profiles.
	 - Made OpenEXR saver optionally save all layers into OpenEXR
	   v2 parts model.  This makes images with multiple layers be
	   extremely efficient.
	 - Bug fixed audio display leaving the window and crashing
	   when playing float audio.
	 - Bug fixed audio timeline tick mark when not playing audio.

v3.0.4   - Made PSD and TIFF reader read alpha channels correctly and
	   support R,G,B,A in layers.
	 - Bug fixed background image compositing which had gotten
	   broken in the stereo transition.

v3.0.3   - Made increasing fps in media info window not reduce the
	   number of frames played (bug).
	 - Added a waveform display to audio only playback, similar
	   to the one in ffplay.
	 - Bug fixed some uses of AVPackets.

v3.0.2   - Bug fixed a problem when playing audio files that would
	   sometimes play them way too fast.
	 - Bug fixed playback of sequences with audio and videos when
	   looping that would loose sync and report NANs and play
	   them way too fast.
	 - Bug fixed EDL's timeline tick mark on playback of such EDL.

v3.0.1   - Allowed loading and saving files with the Windows' native
	   file browser.
	 - Made Preferences a tad more eye friendly by replacing all
	   checkbuttons with raised/pushed checkbuttons.
	 - Made Preferences more eye friendly by rearranging the size
	   of buttons and options.
	 - Made timeline text a bit bigger and more spaced.
	 - Bug fixed rgba shader to not force alpha to 1 when alpha is 0.
	   This prevented subtitles from showing up properly.
	 - Removed the option to reload files when changed on disk as
	   it would create half images and errors.

v3.0.0   - Bug fixed alpha in shaders for stereo display.  Previously
	   a border would surround images.
	 - Bug fixed main Rectangle class.  Previously it could not
	   merge properly.
	 - Made display_window and data_window functions take a frame.
	   This avoids sporadic flashes when loading images.
	 - Avoided recaching on stereo modes when images have been
	   loaded.
	 - Made EDL cuts more seamless.
	 - Avoided a crash when in anaglyph mode and the sources had
	   different size.
	 - Avoided a crash when in stereo mode after selecting
	   stereo crossed.
	 - Avoided a crash when sequences were of different length
	   than the other stereo movie or sequence.
	 - Bug fixed a bug introduced in v2.9.6 when multiview channels
	   were displayed in stereo.
	 - Bug fixed a bug introduced in v2.9.8 when multipart stereo
	   images were loaded.

v2.9.9   - Added stereo interlaced, interlaced columns and
	   checkerboard.
	 - Fixed color queries to support stereo interlaced and
	   checkerboard.
	 - Added saving and loading of stereo images in reels.
	 - Added option to load stereo image on an already loaded
	   image.
	 - Added youtube videos to documentation.
	 - Fixed cache line in timeline when in EDL mode and
	   with edits.

v2.9.8   - Bug fixed OpenEXR reader for multipart image files that
	   are not stereo images.  Previously the files would show
	   the first part only.
	 - The new audio sync was failing on VOBs.  Changed it to
	   make it work.
	 - The win32 release was crashing on file requester due
	   to wrong ffmpeg libraries.  Fixed.

v2.9.7   - Allowed command-line loading of stereo images/movies
	   without any prefix.  The syntax is using the -s keyword:

		   mrViewer -s leftimage.1.exr -s rightimage.1.exr

	 - Updated media information's value and sliders to trigger
	   an update of the slider if the value is typed in.
	 - Added license and configuration information of ffmpeg
	   to the About window.
	 - Reverted an audio optimization which would create problems
	   in audio playback when loops happened early and audio
	   packets decoded into multiple frames.
	 - Reverted a video optimization which was creating problems
	   in reverse playback.
	 - Improved video playback when scrubbing which was skipping
	   some frames incorrectly.  This change should remove all
	   warnings of missing video frames.
	 - Improved audio sync after seeks and in normal mode for
	   Linux and Windows64.
	 - Bug fixed adjusting of EDL when stereo was on.
	 - Made music only tracks not report an invalid index for
	   channel selection.
	 - Removed stereo interlaced as it was not working properly.
	 - Bug fixed unshown frames counter when playing backwards.

v2.9.6   - Made channel selection work with toggles more intuitively.
	   Going to N.x with a 'r' hotkey and then pressing 'r'
	   again will bring you back to "N", not "Color" as before.
	 - Made channel selection smarter to avoid reloads when
	   not needed.  Only switching full layers or multiparts
	   will cause reloads now.
	 - Fixed Unshown Frames (UF:) in Hud Display to correctly
	   count unshown frames.  Previously it would count them
	   with an addition of one to it each time.
	 - Fixed a random crash that would happen when LUT was
	   activated and the sequence was still being loaded.
	 - Fixed color picker not showing the right colors on
	   stereo images once cache was cleared.
	 - Fixed a memory leak of thumbnail pictures.
	 - Added an elapsed and remaining timings to saving
	   a sequence or a movie.
	 - Bug fixed Saving of OpenGL Snapshots for a sequence of
	   images.  Previously it would crash.

v2.9.5   - Improved OpenEXR loader by a factor of 2.
	 - Made OpenEXR saver default to PIZ wavelet compression,
	   instead of None.
	 - Made audio track selection not throw when invalid tracks
	   are used.  If an invalid track is used, the audio is
	   muted ( track is -1 ).
	 - Same thing with subtitle track.
	 - Bug fixed Media Info Window not updating on frame change.
	 - Made images saved with left. or right. prefix not change
	   to %V. prefix automatically.

v2.9.4   - RMB->Pixel->Copy Pixel Value now respects lut and
	   gamma if active.
	 - Changing volume or audio track now effects both
	   stereo images.
	 - Bug fixed avi saver to work with images whose
	   resolution is not a multiple of two.
	 - Bug fixed thumbnail creation when image is not
	   a multiple of two.
	 - Bug fixed gaps in cache that would appear in timeline
	   when playing in loop.
	 - Updated to latest ffmpeg version.
	 - Changed 'o' alpha overlay shortcut to 'v', to avoid clash
	   with 'o' in changing timeline out point.
	 - Made channel list work with submenus, for easier access
	   and less clutter.
	 - Added stereo interlaced to show images interlaced.  For
	   this to work it is necessary to be in zoom 1.0 or
	   presentation mode.
	 - Bug fixed installation on Linux relying on symlinks.

v2.9.3   - Bug fixed saving of OpenExr files when data window was
	   smaller than display window.  Previously it would crash.
	 - Bug fixed a number of memory leaks.
	 - Bug fixed fit image when in stereo side by side mode.
	 - Bug fixed saving of files in start directory instead of
	   directory set in file requester.
	 - Added support for stereo loading of two set of images
	   or two sets of movie files with a common prefix.  The
	   syntax is a single letter prefix or a full keyword:
	   Examples:
		  rootname.prefix.number.extension
		  da20.L.0001.exr
		  da20.R.0001.exr
	   For movies:
		  rootname.prefix.extension
		  da20.left.mov
		  da20.right.mov

	   In the file requester, the movies and sequences
	   will appear as:
		  da20.%v.mov      # for da20.L|R.mov
		  da20.%V.%04d.exr # for da20.left|right.0001.exr

	   The names of left and right and L and R can be changed
	   with environment variables. See documentation.

	   Current Limitations
	   -------------------
	   Currently, it is not possible to mix a movie and a
	   sequence in stereo viewing.
	   It is also not possible to view in stereo channels
	   other than RGBA.
	   Finally, a background image is available for
	   the left eye only.

v2.9.2   - Bug fixed removing a directory from Favorites.
	 - Removed all database functions as noone was using them and
	   they remained under developed.  As a result of this,
	   opening files is much faster now.
	 - Added Unix-like permissions to file details in file
	   requester.
	 - Made file requester column labels appear translated in
	   Spanish locale.
	 - Added a Preload Cache option to both the menus (Image)
	   and the Preferencess->Cache.  Turning it on loads the
	   image sequences in the background but it makes the GUI
	   slow.  Thus, the default is off.

v2.9.1   - Made selection of Favorite follow preferences of a single
	   click to make it consistent with the travelling of folders.
	 - Made context sensitive menus in file requester respect
	   the user's locale settings.
	 - Fixed a hanging bug when selecting favorites from the pull
	   down or when changing file type from the other pull down.

v2.9.0   - Moved compilation to use ninja build system on both platforms.
	 - Fixed some documentation in Spanish and added some more info on
	   the English docs.
	 - Bug fixed changing FPS in the Preferences and hitting okay will
	   no longer change FPS.  FPS set in Preferences is for starting
	   the viewer.
	 - Bug fixed loops starting at other frame than 1.  Previously,
	   the looping would happen twice the frame set.  So if you had
	   set the loop at frame 30, the loop would happen at frame 60.
	 - Bug fixed gaps in cache when looping small videos.
	 - Made the file requester much nicers and multithreaded to
	   load previews of movies, sequences and images.

	 - Fixed audio trashing memory sometimes, which could lead
	   to a crash.

v2.8.6   - Bug fix of audio caches being unlimited.
	 - Bug fix of reverse playback with audio disappearing.
	 - Further refinement of caches when scrubbing for smoother
	   playback.
	 - Audio offset works with positive values (ie. audio shifted
	   before video ).  Movies and sequences of frames can be
	   saved with added audio shifted.
	 - Added command-line flag (o) to shift audio.

v2.8.5   - Quick bug fix release to remove the bug of playback going
	   too fast due to not syncing with audio on some movie files.

v2.8.2   - Removed incorrect error when buffers were full.
	 - Added routine to print out decode status in natural
	   language instead of a code.
	 - Allowed saving of opengl snapshot to movie files.  This
	   works identically to saving normal movies, but requires user
	   to Save explicitally with the GL Snapshots option.
	 - Bug fixed opengl snapshot saving to save the view without
	   any additional green headroom.
	 - Bug fixed opengl snapshots saving being one frame behind.
	 - Bug fixed a crash when saving movies whose first
	   audio frame was 0.

v2.8.1   - Improved playback of movies sometimes when pts was skipping
	   a frame.
	 - Minor speeding up in movie playback.
	 - Bug fixed playback of image sequences with attached sound,
	   which would freeze on a frame.
	 - Added the option to offset the attached audio file so as to
	   sync the audio without cutting the original clip.
	 - Documented RMB menu options.
	 - Turned off PostgreSQL database driver on Linux by default
	   so as to avoid errors on startup for new users.

	   algorithm was not frame accurate.
	 - Bug fixed playback of one sample movie (PoTC.VOB), which
	   would start with frame frozen.
	 - Bug fixed movies that had B frames in it and would show
	   incorrectly.

v2.7.9   - Bug fixed start frame on BG image, which would offset by 1
	   frame.

	 - Fixed file requester not showing negative frames correctly.
	 - Fixed file association for jpg, png, tiff, and others on Linux
	   installers.
	 - Fixed ImageMagick saving.  Gamma is baked in instead of passed
	   to image attribute.
	 - Made ImageMagick loader load all images as gamma 1.0,
	   regardless, as it incorrectly tags images as gamma 0.4545.
	 - Fixed Clone Image crash due to wrong path check.
	 - Fixed Clone Image not cloning CTL's IDT transform.
	 - Internal images like SMPTE color bars don't start with a RRT.
	 - When saving, if LUT is active, ACES Metadata saving is turned
	   on. If LUT is not active, ACES Metadata is turned off.

v2.7.7   - Clamped values of ITU 709 as it could result in overflows and
	   saturated colors.
	 - Windows64 version of mrViewer was distributed with 16bits
	   ImageMagick instead of 32 bits HDRI.
	 - Added sun raster images to mime types under Linux.

	   the real duration.
	 - Streams duration are shown as frames, seconds and time instead
	   of seconds and time only.
	 - Bug fixed openexr loader with lumma as it was trashing memory
	   and possibly hanging the viewer. This also makes the loader a tad
	   faster.
	 - Made R,G,B,A,L,Z hotkeys default to main channels only.
	   Previously they would randomly change depending on what
	   channel was selected.
	 - Made LUT not include image in lut path, so multiple images
	   can share the same lut.  This makes it calculate less luts per
	   invocation.

v2.7.6   - Fixed LUT comparison of two images.  Previously, LUT could turn
	   off without any warning when switching images.
	 - Fixed fit image when image was flipped and not stereo.
	 - Fixed creation of thumbnails of movies created with ITU 601
	   colors.
	 - Fixed color queries of movies created with ITU 601 colors.

	   cancel on the last empty LMT.
	 - Fixed a memory corruption if LMT's Choose requester was chosen
	   twice.
	 - Fixed the defaults gamma, gain and mask float values in the Spanish
	   locale (changing the dot for a comma).

	   conversions were not handled well.

v2.7.4   - Bug fixed a crashing bug in Windows 32 when displaying the
	   image information window.
	 - Added support for GradeRef in ACES.  This is done thru a list
	   of LMTs.

	   output more information when it fails loading it.
	 - Preference window would not show the CTL_MODULE_PATH variable
	   under the Spanish locale.
	 - Made ACEScsc ctl scripts appear when listing LMTs.
	 - Removed silly error of not finding the ACESclip file for files
	   that don't have matching ACESclip files.

v2.7.3   - Made LUT pixel and color area lookups a tad faster.
	 - Added an option in the pixel bar's RGBA toolbar to switch to
	   display pixels as:
	   * Full (show pixel values with gamma, gain and lut if on),
	   * Gamma (show pixel values with gamma and gain only)
	   * Original (show pixel values unchanged by gain, gamma or lut)
	 - Made color area window, histogram and vectorscope react
	   automatically to changes in gamma, gain or lut.  This makes
	   all tools more interactive and more useful.
	 - All color tools (pixel values, color area info, vectorscope
	   and histogram) respect the pixel values setting in the main
	   pixel toolbar.
	 - Upgraded ImageMagick to a newer, 32 bits float HDRI version.
	 - Updated all small popup menus to not draw the glyph for
	   readability issues.
	 - Bug fixed a crashing bug on Windows when Add to Favorites
	   was pushed.  This bug is due to a broken libintl on windows.
	 - Bug fixed a similar crash on Windows when saving a reel.
	 - More translated messages into Spanish.

	   when available. Made reader/writer use TransformID instead of name.
	 - Bug fixed RPM installer not creating ln -s /usr/bin/mrViewer
	   correctly.
	 - Color picker now can show colors with the LUT applied.  This
	   makes the gui (zoom) respond a tad slower when the LUT is on.
	   As such a preferences option was added.
	 - Added switch in Preferences to show pixel color values after LUT.
	 - Made DEB/RPM installer on Linux place an icon in desktop in
	   any language locale.
	 - DEB/RPM will register file associations (mime-types) to all of
	   mrViewer's recognized files.
	 - Added translation to Spanish when that's the locale default.

	   (mrViewer-64 and mrViewer-32 respectively).

v2.6.9   - Bug fixed Cancel button in CTL requester.
	 - Added a Load button to CTL requester to load CTL scripts not in
	   CTL_MODULE_PATH.

	 - Added support to ACES 1.0 Clip Metadata to store all transforms
	   in an XML file.

v2.6.8   - Bug fixed lut creation on 32 and 128 sizes.  Previously, they would
	   get created and not cached.
	 - Adapted CTL pipeline to be compatible with ACES 1.0.  The one
	   rendering transform and all output device transforms from ACES
	   can be used.
	   Note that the previous transform_RRT and ODT_monitor have been
	   deprecated as they operate on XYZ.

v2.6.7   - Added installers for both platforms. The main benefit is
	   for Windows where shortcuts and an icon in Desktop are created.

v2.6.6.2 - Bug fixed center and fit image when pixel ratio was different
	   than 1.
	 - Bug fixed mirror X and mirror Y when different data/display
	   window is present.  Previously, the flipping was done within
	   the data window.
	 - Added back again the S and E buttons in the timeline to set
	   the start and ending of clips or the timeline.  The E button
	   works well, but the S button is subject to movies caches.
	 - Use ffmpeg's png loader when cache is off.  The loader is really
	   fast but requires opening of the file with the avi (ffmpeg) loader.
	   That means you cannot load the png sequence and then switch to the
	   non-cache loader without reloading the sequence.

v2.6.6.1 - Reworked the Cache Preferences to allow:
	   * Not using any cache for streaming images directly from disk.
	     The performance of this is extremely dependant on the images being
	     loaded.
	   * 8 bit caches to save RAM at the expense of baking the gamma in.
	   * Scale to proxy images (one half, one quarter or one eighth of the
	     original size) also to save RAM.

v2.6.5.6 - Made caching work on all sequences in reels and timeline in EDL.
	   Progress goes from one sequence to the next.
	 - Removed reloading of movie files when they change in disk.
	   Previously the whole reel would get corrupted.
	 - Replaced zlib1.dll in win32 distribution as it was corrupt and
	   would cause crashes when loading some exr images.

v2.6.5.5 - Added a green bar display for frame caches in the timeline for
	   both movies and sequences.
	 - Bug fixed a hanging problem when exiting while playing backwards
	   movie with audio.
	 - Bug fixed a cache problem not caching the first frame when playing
	   backwards.
	 - Changed Release folder to mrViewer-v$VERSION folder.

v2.6.5.4 - Bug fixed some problems with loop playback of movie files in EDL.

	 - EDL timeline now supports play and step hotkeys.
	 - Fixed EXR loader not loading exif attributes.
	 - Fixed EXR saver to save all known attributes of image, except tiling.

	   delete them or move them somewhere else.
	 - Added Merge tool to undo the Cut tool.
	 - Fixed name of zlib1.dll in windows32 distributions.

v2.6.5.0 - Simplified and sped up exr loader.

	 - Updated -h (help) command-line on windows to pop up a console with
	   instructions.

v2.6.4.0 - Added a starting audio volume preference to the default
	   audio preferences.
	 - Made preferences run when the user hits ok.  Previously ok did
	   nothing.  This allows testing preferences much easier.
	 - Pixel Info is now available for background images even when those
	   background images have a different size than the foreground one.
	   Note that Color Info Selection shows only the foreground image
	   values.
	 - Bug fixed file requester when clicking with rmb on a folder
	   which would access the folder instead of the menus.

	   the data window effects the positioning of the display window.
	 - Adapted fit image function to handle moving data window.
	 - Adapted color info for moving data window.
	 - Added partial support for animated GIFs. As GIFs don't store
	   the length of the animation, a length of 100 frames is used as
	   default.
	 - Adapted draw routines to draw in data window.
	 - Adapted masking routines to draw in data window.
	 - Fixed a bug that would cause a crash when the image information
	   window would get opened for a multipart OpenEXR image.

v2.6.0.0 - Added options to save H264 movie files in YUV420 or YUV444.
	 - Added options to save audio in MP3 format, but there's still some
	   "pops" in the output of most files and sync issues.
	 - Fixed searching to a point with audio not being found.  Now
	   searching is more solid.
	 - Made audio saving a non-default option due to the bugs that still
	   plague it.

v2.5.9.1 - Switching images no longer auto refits them in view when autorefit
	   is on.  It keeps zoom level and offset so as to compare two images
	   at closeup. Only when window is resized or the image is loaded,
	   autofit takes over.
	 - Made Single Instance of viewer an alert when another instance is
	   running.  The alert also tells user where to remove the lock file.
