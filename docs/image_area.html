<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Image Area</h3>

The Image Area is your main viewport. &nbsp;It usually displays one
image at a time, albeit in the future it will be possible to display
several images together.<br>

<br>

Within your viewport, your mouse pointer will change to a cross to more
clearly indicate what pixel you are pointing at.<br>

<br>

You can manipulate the viewport using your mouse and hotkeys in a
similar way to how maya and 3dmax work. &nbsp;Using your mousewheel
you
are able to zoom in and out from the pixel your cursor is pointing at.<br>

<br>

Using the
<div class="hotkey">LMB</div>

you can select an
area. &nbsp;The main purpose of selecting an area currently is to
get
the color information of the whole area. &nbsp;See <a href="color_area.html">The Color Area Window</a>.<br>

<br>

Using the
<div class="hotkey">MMB</div>

or
<div class="hotkey">ALT+LMB</div>

,
you can scroll around the image canvas.<br>

<br>

Using the
<div class="hotkey">Mousewheel</div>

, you can zoom in and out of the location where the mouse is pointing
at.<br>

<br>

Using the
<div class="hotkey">Shift + Mouse Move</div>

, you can scrub the movie or image sequence to pinpoint a section of it.

<br>
<br>
Using the
<div class="hotkey">RMB</div>

, you can bring up a context sensitive menu:<br>
- The <div class="menu">File</div> submenu allows you to load or save images, sequences or movie files.  Depending on the format you choose to save your image in, you will likely get a requester with options.<br>
- The <div class="menu">Windows</div> submenu is the same as the <div class="menu">W</div> button in the top toolbar and allows you to access all the subwindows of mrViewer.<br>
- The <div class="menu">View</div> submenu allows you to toggle the safe areas of the image, display window, data window, film masking, and HUD display.<br>
- The <div class="menu">Image</div> submenu allows you to switch to the previous or next image in the reel or edl, allows you to clone the current frame (useful when mrViewer is used as a viewer to renders), attach an ICC profile or CTL script,  set the image as a background image and toggle the display of the bg image.<br>
- The <div class="menu">Audio</div> submenu allows you to attach and detach a new or different audio channel to the sequence or video.<br>
- The <div class="menu">Pixel</div> submenu allows you to copy the pixel values to paste them in some other application.<br>
- The <div class="menu">Monitor</div> submenu allows you to attach an ICC color profile or CTL script to the display.<br>
