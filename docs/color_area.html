  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

In addition to the pixel information that is provided in the Pixel
Toolbar, mrViewer also supports a Color Area Window that displays color
information about the currently selected area.<br>

The Color Area window displays the coordinates of the rectangle area
selected, its&nbsp;width and height in pixels as well as its total
size
in pixels.<br>

For the window to display any information, you need to make sure you are in area select mode, go to the 
<a href="paint.html"><div class="menu">Paint Window</div></a> and select the first tool (the square).
<br>
With the select tool you need to have an image or
movie loaded, and select an area of it with the <div class="hotkey">LMB</div>
.<br>
The area can be just a point to remove the square from view.<br>


The information displayed are the minimum and maximum values of the
Red, Green, Blue and Alpha channels for the currently selected layer
and area. &nbsp;The range represents the absolute difference
between
the maximum and minimum values. &nbsp;Finally, the mean represents
the
mean average of the pixels in the area for that particular channel.<br>

Similar information is displayed for the Hue, Saturation, Value and
Luminance.<br>

You can select any of the rows and then use the
<div class="hotkey">RMB</div>

, to bring up a menu to allow you to copy the values of the channels
onto the clipboard, so as to paste them into some other application.<br>

<br>

If you click the <div class="hotkey">RMB</div> on the mean color display widget, the mean colors can also be copied to the clipboard.
