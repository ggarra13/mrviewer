<h4>mrViewer does not show its command-line options.</h4>

Whenever you try to start up image viewer, it does not log information to the console.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer:</span><br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">This is a problem with windows.  To see the options type:
<br>
<div class="console"> mrViewer -h </div>
<br>
The options will appear a new console window.  To see the rest of the messages, go to <div class="menu">Windows->Logs</div>
</span>

<h4>mrViewer does not start giving a ms-api-core* message or similar</h4>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer:</span><br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">This can be several problems.   You may be mixing x86 and x64 DLLs.  You can check them with the Dependency Walker utility freely available on the internet.  Another possibility is that you may have a version of mrViewer compiled with the Win10 SDK which makes it compatible only with Win8 / Win8.1 / Win10.   By mistake several old versions of mrViewer were using that SDK.</span><br>
