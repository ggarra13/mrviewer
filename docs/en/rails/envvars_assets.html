<h1 style="text-align: center;">Environment Variables for Assets</h1>
<p>By default, when mrViewer views an image, movie or audio, it will log it in the database.  However, it is sometimes useful to attach a shot, sequence or show to the image being logged.  mrViewer relies on some useful environment variables for this.</p>
<p>The environment variable SHOW determines the show the image belongs to.  It should be a small name, like 'hulk'.</p>
The environment variable SHOT determines the shot the image belongs to.  It should be a 2 or 3 character string followed by a number.  Example: da023, ep123.</p>
<p>The optional environment variable SEQ determines the sequence the image belongs to.  If not set, it is guessed from the first letters of the shot.  As with the show, it should be a small name, usually a prefix of the shot.</p>

<p>Finally, the environment variable USER or USERNAME is used to log in the user that viewed the image for the first time.</p>
