<h3>Loading Preferences</h3>

The Loading Preferences tab allows you to configure how the image, video and audio is loaded. <br>
<br>

<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

  <tbody>

    <tr>

      <td><img style="width: 640px; height: 487px;" alt="" src="images/PreferencesLoading.png"></td>
      <td>
	<div class="menu">Use OIIO for JPG/PNG loading</div>
	<br>
	When this option is off, JPG/PNG images are loaded in a multithread way by the FFMPEG library.  When this option if on, OIIO will be responsible for loading the frames.  This used to determine how caching of frames worked, but now there's no difference.  You should probably leave the setting in the off position.
	<br>
	<br>
	<div class="menu">Load Sequences on Drag&amp;Drop</div>
	<br>
	When this option is on, any image that is dragged and dropped in the main mrViewer window will be treated as a sequence and the full sequence will be loaded.  If this option is off, only a single frame will be loaded.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<div class="menu">Load Sequence on File Association & Command Line</div>
	<br>
	When this option is on, any image that is loaded thru a file association or through the command-line, it will attempt to load the full sequence.  If it is off, only the single image will get loaded.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<div class="menu">Auto load images as they change on disk</div>
	<br>
	When this option is on, mrViewer will monitor the image on disk and will update it as soon as it sees a change in it.
