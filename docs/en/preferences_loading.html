<h3>Loading Preferences</h3>

The Loading Preferences tab allows you to configure how the image, video and audio is loaded. <br>
<br>

<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

  <tbody>

    <tr>

      <td><img style="width: 437px; height: 487px;" alt="" src="images/PreferencesLoading.png"></td>
      <td>
	<div class="menu">Load Sequences on Drag&amp;Drop</div>
	<br>
	When this option is on, any image that is dragged and dropped in the main mrViewer window will be treated as a sequence and the full sequence will be loaded.  If this option is off, only a single frame will be loaded.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<div class="menu">Load Timecode when possible</div>
	<br>
	When this option is on, any timecode found in the movie or in the image file (OpenEXR) is interpreted and the frame will be an offset of the start timecode value.
	<br>
	<br>
	<div class="menu">Auto load images as they change on disk</div>
	<br>
	When this option is on, mrViewer will monitor the image on disk and will update it as soon as it sees a change in it.
