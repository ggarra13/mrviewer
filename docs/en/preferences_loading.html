<h3>Loading Preferences</h3>

The Loading Preferences tab allows you to configure how the image, video and audio is loaded. <br>
<br>

<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

  <tbody>

    <tr>

      <td><img style="width: 437px; height: 487px;" alt="" src="images/PreferencesLoading.png"></td>
      <td>
	<div class="menu">Load Sequences on Drag&amp;Drop</div>
	<br>
	When this option is on, any image that is dragged and dropped in the main mrViewer window will be treated as a sequence and the full sequence will be loaded.  If this option is off, only a single frame will be loaded.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<div class="menu">Load Sequence on File Association & Command Line</div>
	<br>
	When this option is on, any image that is loaded thru a file association or through the command-line, it will attempt to load the full sequence.  If it is off, only the single image will get loaded.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<div class="menu">Auto load images as they change on disk</div>
	<br>
	When this option is on, mrViewer will monitor the image on disk and will update it as soon as it sees a change in it.
