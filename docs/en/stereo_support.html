	mrViewer supports stereo images, sequences and movie files.  Stereo OpenEXR images (.sxr) are supported natively.  For others, to load a stereo sequence, you can rely on them being named with left/right or L/R prefix. <br>
So for example, you'd have on disk:<br>
<br>
<br>
<div class="console">
dc56.left.0001-0100.exr<br>
dc56.right.0001-0100.exr
</div>
<br>
or:
<br>
<div class="console">
pod.L.mov<br>
pod.R.mov
</div>
<br>
<br>
The keywords left-right can be controlled by the environment variable <div class="hotkey">MRV_STEREO_NAME_PAIRS</div>.  The L/R characters can be controlled by the environment variable <div class="hotkey">MRV_STEREO_CHAR_PAIRS</div>.  
Example:
<br><br>
<div class="console">
export MRV_STEREO_NAME_PAIRS=izquierda:derecha<br>
export MRV_STEREO_CHAR_PAIRS=I:D
</div> 
<br><br>
To refer to these files in the command line you'd use the <div class="hotkey">%v</div> (for L/R) or <div class="hotkey">%V</div> (for left/right) stand-ins.
<br><br>
<div class="console">
mrViewer pod.%v.mov dc56.%V.@@@@.exr
</div> 
<br><br> The files will appear in this same way in the file requester when you try to load them.
<br><br>
In addition to the above, mrViewer allows loading two sequences or one sequence and one movie file command-line for stereo playback.  For that, it is needed to specify both with the -s shortcut (--stereo).  For example:
<br><br>
<div class="console">
mrViewer -s ba25-fg.mov -s ba25-fg.%04d.png
</div> 
<br>
The first image specified is taken to be the left eye, while the second invocation is taken to be the right eye.
<br>
<br>Note that the --stereo option does not play well with images that already have the left/right prefix in their names.<br> <br>
<br>
The Types of Stereo Supported are controlled in the 3D Stereo Options Window, Output option.
