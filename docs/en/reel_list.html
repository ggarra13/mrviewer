<br>

The Reel List Window allows you to see all reels loaded as well as all
images loaded in the currently active reel.<br>

It also allows you to perform some additional operations on the images
loaded.<br>

<br>

A reel is basically a list of images stored under a particular name.
&nbsp;This list of images can be reordered simply by doing drag and
drop of the image. &nbsp;You can also quickly switch from one image
or
movie to another by clicking on any item on the list.<br>

<br>

mrViewer allows you to also load reels (.reel files) from the command
line or by doing drag and drop. &nbsp;When loading a reel, all the
images listed in the reel will be loaded.<br>

<br>

The reel window also allows you to open a new image or movie, save the
current image or frame, make a clone of the current image (useful for
3d renders) or remove the image from the reel.<br>

You can also attach a new CTL transform (3D Lut) to an image, make an
image always appear as part of the background or play back the whole
reel as an EDL.<br>

<br>

<h3><a name="Compositing_Images"></a>Compositing
Images</h3>

mrViewer supports some basic, non destructive A over B compositing.
&nbsp;This compositing is for display purposes only and it is not
intended for saving composited images.<br>

<br>

Within the Reel List Window, it is possible to select an image and then
click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">BG</span>
button to make that image be a background image. &nbsp;Afterwards,
you
can then switch to a new image and the background image will be
displayed in the background. &nbsp;The background image is always
stretched to fit the size of the foreground image.<br>

<br>

The main purpose of this feature is to allow you to interactively see
your 3d renders over a background plate. &nbsp;This works
particularly
well when reading a foreground image that is a file that changes on
disk or when reading a virtual
image, such as a mental ray render stub.

<h3><a name="Playing_Movies_as_an_EDL_Reel"></a>Playing
Movies as an EDL Reel</h3>

One feature of mrViewer is that it allows you to display multiple
sequences or movies together. &nbsp;If you load several files into
a reel, you can then toggle EDL mode on and off from the Reel List Window.<br><br>You can also toggle it on and off with the Numeric Keypad's <div class="hotkey">Enter</div> key.<br>

The EDL mode allows you to show all movies in a reel one after the
other, as if all of them had been edited together into a big movie file.<br>

<h3>Removing Images from Reel List</h3>

Once you are done with some image sequence or movie file you might want to get
rid of it.  To do so, select the image in the reel list window and press the Delete key (<div class="hotkey">Del</div>).<br>
