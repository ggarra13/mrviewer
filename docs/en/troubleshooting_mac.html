<h3 style="text-align: center;">Mac issues</h3>

<h4>mrViewer does not start up.</h4>

Whenever you try to start up mrViewer, a requester says it is an insecure application downloaded from www.sourceforge.net.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer:</span><br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">Starting with Mojave and, worse in, Catalina, Apple is forcing all its developers into a u$99 contract in order to notarize their applications, so they are checked for malware.  Don't worry.  mrViewer is perfectly safe.  To open it, use <div="menu">CTRL + LMB -> Open</div> which will open the application for the first time and the setting should be remembered.

<h4>Some image formats load as 8-bit or 16-bit only or with
incorrect alpha channel.</h4>

Whenever I try loading an image like a tiff file, it loads only as a
16-bit or 8-bit only file or an unpremult alpha channel even though it
is a float file with alpha channel.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer: </span><br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">This is usually a
problem with your ImageMagick library. mrViewer expects ImageMagick to
have been compiled with 32-bit float channel support, but most Mac
distributions compile it with 16-bit only. &nbsp;The mrViewer shell
wrapper script should set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to its own
local ImageMagick library to avoid problems, but perhaps you've changed
it or have a different setup. &nbsp;Make sure to set up your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to mrViewer's ImageMagick library or compile
your own version of ImageMagick but with 32-bit support.</span><br>

<h4>Some avi or movie files do not play their audio.</h4>

Sometimes, when loading some movie or avi files, the video plays, but
there's no audio.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer:</span>
<br>
This often indicates the lack of an appropriate codec for playing the
audio in the ffmpeg library. &nbsp;Open the image information window and check the audio
track you are interested in. &nbsp;Check whether&nbsp;"Known Codec"
says "Yes". &nbsp;If it says no, ffmpeg does not have the needed
codec for playback. &nbsp; Check also the name of the codec and its
fourcc id. &nbsp;Most codecs go by their name but others have become
popular by their fourcc id (DIVX or XVID, for example).<br>
Movie and avi files are just a format for storing a movie.
&nbsp;However, the way the movie and audio is compressed is handled by
what is referred as a codec (a codify - decodify routine or plugin).
&nbsp;mrViewer ships with a library that handles almost every codec
currently known. &nbsp;However, some of these codecs are proprietary and are patented.<br>
In countries that accept software patents like the U.S., this requires
the paying of license fees for distribution or for decoding them.
