Tracking</h1><p>
One unique feature of mrViewer is its built-in asset tracking system.
&nbsp;With it, every image or movie file that any person in your
facility views will be recorded into a generic database and it will be
sorted by show, sequence and shot.<br></p><h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Setting
up the Database</h2><p>For mrViewer to save your images in
a database, it is necessary for you to specify the database connection
as well as prepare a compatible database for mrViewer.</p><p>The
database server can be any machine in your facility and not the local
machine where mrViewer runs on, but all other machines need to be able
to access it through a TCP/IP connection. &nbsp; You can also set
up different servers for different cluster of machines, to alleviate
the load on large facilities.</p><p>Film Aura recommends
using a Linux server for your database due to their reliability and
best network throughput.</p>Currently, mrViewer supports the
PostgreSQL database by default which is the most comprehensive free and
open source database. &nbsp;Other database drivers may be added
later (note that distribution of such drivers is often not possible for
GPL only databases like MySQL due to licensing restrictions).</body></html>
