<br>
The Image menu allows switching to the Next or Previous file in the Reel List or EDL.
<br>
<br>
The Clone option allows cloning the frame to compare later with something else..
<br>
<br>
Preload caches loads the image sequences in the background.
<br>
<br>
Clear caches clears all file sequence caches to save memory.
<br>
<br>
The Update Single Frame in Cache will update the current frame in the cache.  This option is to be used in case you don't have Auto load images as they change on disk in the <div class="menu">Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Loading</div> section.
<br>
<br>
The following CTL and ICC menu entries are only available when OCIO is not your preferred color correction setting.
<br>
<br>
The Attach CTL Input Device Transform allows you to load a CTL IDT script and apply it to the current view.  The CTL Input Device Transform are usually created by film manufacturers for each camera and sometimes for different settings too.  You can have a single CTL IDT script per lut.
<br>
<br>
The Add CTL Look Mod Transform allows you to apply a look mod transform which is normally used to apply a distinct variation to the image (for example, a bleach pass), without actually modifying the pixels.
<br>
<br>
The Attach CTL Rendering Transform applies a rendering transform to take the pixels from an ACES workspace to the final OCES workspace.  This transform is usually the standard Reference Rendering Transform (RRT currently) and requires no change.
<br>
<br>
The Attach ICC Color Profile allows attaching a color profile to the image.  This color profile should end in XYZ color space.  It is used if no CTL script is used.  The practice of using ICC profiles is now deprecated.
<br>
<br>
The Mirror Option allows mirroring the image in X or in Y.
<br>
<br>
The Set as Background image will set the current foreground image as a background image for later compositing or wipe.
<br>
<br>
The Switch FG and BG option will do as it says.  It will take the foreground image and make it the background image while it takes the background image and makes it the foreground one.
<br>
<br>
Toggle Background allows toggling the compositing of the foreground image over the background image on and off.  In order for compositing to work, the foreground image must have an alpha channel.
