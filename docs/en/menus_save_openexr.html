<br>
The File Save OpenEXR options allows you to select options of how mrViewer saves the OpenEXR image(s).  The window appears whenever you save a file with extension .exr.
<br>
<br>
The Requester allows you to select the compression algorithm.  The lossless compression algorithns are: None, RLE, ZIP, ZIP Scanline, PIZ Wavelet.  The lossy compression algorithms are B44, B44A DWAA and DWAB.
<br>
<br>
For the DWAA/DWAB algorithms, it is possible to select the quality/ratio of the compression.  That is the slider below the compression options.
<br>
<br>
Besides the compression algorithm, you can also select the pixel depth, which can be unsigned integer, half float or full float.  For most cases Half will be enough.
<br>
<br>
OpenEXR supports multiple layers and selecting saving all layers will allow you to save all layers of the image loaded.  mrViewer saves an OpenEXR v2.0 multipart file for speed.
<br>
<br>
Finally, you can choose to save the ACESclip Metadata (all CTL transforms) into a similarly named file to your OpenExr file.  This file will be read in automatically once you load the OpenEXR file or sequence.
