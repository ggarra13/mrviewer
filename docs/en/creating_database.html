<body><h1 style="text-align: center;">Creating the Database</h1><p>There are two ways to create your database. &nbsp;One if using basic SQL which is specific to each database.</p><p>The
other, more powerful way, is to use rails' migrations with the rails
project provided with mrViewer. &nbsp;Either way, you will need to
create an administrative user in the database which will have a
password and have permissions to create or drop tables in the database.</p><p>This user is to be called mrviewer or you will have to adjust the file in rails/assets2d/config/database.yml.</p><p>
Once that is done, you need to run from a window as root user:

<p><div class="console"><span style="font-weight: bold;">$ apt-get install ruby1.9.1 rubygems # or whatever packet manager you use</br>
$ gem install rails</br>
$ gem install rake</br>
</div>

<p>
Now, from the main rails/assets2d directory:</p><p></p>

<p><div class="console"><span style="font-weight: bold;">
<p>> rake db:schema:load</p>
</div>

That will create the database called asset2d_development.  To create the production database, use:

<p><div class="console"><span style="font-weight: bold;">
<p>> export RAILS_ENV=production  # for bash, use set for mswin console</p>
<p>> rake db:schema:load</p>
</div>

The real database is assets2d_production and the mrViewer program will use it, but the others are offered as trials.
