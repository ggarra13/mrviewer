<h3>Playback Preferences</h3>

<br>

The playback preferences tab allows you to modify how mrViewer's
playback and timeline works on start up.<br>

<br>

<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

  <tbody>

    <tr>

      <td><img style="width: 437px; height: 487px;" alt="" src="images/PreferencesPlayback.png"></td>

      <br>

      <div class="menu">Defaults</div>

      <br>

      <td>
      <div class="menu">Auto Playback</div>
      <br>

When this option is turned on, as soon as mrViewer loads all the files,
it will try to start playing them.<br>
<br>
As other defaults, you can change the default speed (FPS) of the timeline as well as its looping mode.  The FPS of the timeline only takes effect on sequences, not videos which already have an encoded FPS and it works only when you have Override FPS active.
<br>
<br>
      </div>
	<div class="menu">Scrub Sensitivity</div>
	<div>
	This option controls how scrubbing works.  Smaller increments mean less travel of the mouse to skip a frame, while higher increments mean much more travel of the mouse to change the frame.  Scrubbing by default is a toggle. <div class="hotkey">SHIFT</div> toggles it on, then you use the mouse to move left/right, and <div class="hotkey">ALT</div> or <div class="hotkey">CTRL</div> to exit the mode.
	</div>
	<br>
	<br>

      <div class="menu">Timeline</div>

      <div>This section allows
you
to toggle how the timeline displays the time.  It can be in frames, seconds, time, Drop Timecode, Non-Drop Timecode.<br>

      </div>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>
