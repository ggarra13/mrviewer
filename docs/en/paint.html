mrViewer supports some action tools to be used in manipulating the image or video.

<br>

The Action Tools contains, from top to bottom, left to right, the scrub action (default for LMB), the move picture action (Scale with CTRL+LMB), the color area selection button (default Shift+LMB), the grease pencil tool which allows you to draw with the color and pen size you select below, the text tool for adding single lines of text, and the eraser tool to partially erase some of the drawings.<br>
<br>

<br>

You can select any of the tools and <div class="hotkey">LMB</div> will perform the operation of the tool.  <br>
The scrub tool allows you to scrub the playback with audio.
The move picture tool allows you to move and scale the picture to position it somewhere else in the canvas.  It mainly allows you to have the foreground and background in some different area of the window.
In drawing or erasing the tool will allow you to draw as you drag.
In the case of the text tool, a popup first allows you to select the text, font and font size you will use for the text.  After you set that, you can position the text by dragging.
<br>

The third row of the tools allows you to select whether the drawing you make is used in all frames or only in the current frame of the movie.
<br>
The drawings you make can have ghosting on for the previous and for the next frame.  This allows you to see the frame previous or following and thus helps you to draw animations one frame at a time.

<br>
Finally, the last row contains two arrows which allow you to undo or redo the last shapes drawn.  The undo buffer contains no limit other than the memory of your computer.
