A Vectorscope is a tool used mainly in video productions as a debugging
aid. &nbsp;It basically shows you color information.<br>

The display represents color in a circle or pie and each square
(R,M,B,C,G,Y) represents a&nbsp;pure primary or secondary color
according to the NTSC or PAL standards. &nbsp;No red, magenta,
blue,
cyan, green or yellow color is expected to be brighter/more saturated
than the squares (ie. go beyond them).<br>

Each color of the color bars, for example, is expected to land
perfectly within each of the squares.<br>

However, when dealing with computer graphics or bad video, it is
perfectly possible for a signal to create colors that are too bright or
saturated for the TV standards. &nbsp; If a color is too bright or
saturated, it might lead to problems in the broadcasting of the
transmission and may force the tv channel to have to desaturate all
your image.
