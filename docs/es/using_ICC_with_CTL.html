One ICC transform is attached to the main view window and represents
the monitor, video or film stock. &nbsp;
&nbsp;This transform is set in the main preferences window, in the CTL section. &nbsp;Most projects will require users to set the device transform only once and not change it and it is recommended you use the MRV_ODT_ICC_PROFILE environment variable.</p><p>Each image can support its own ICC profile.  For that, you need to add an ICC profile with the RMB.  There's an option called Image->Attach ICC Profile, which does the obvious.<p>
Once ICC profiles are loaded, you can examine their contents in the ICC profile window.</p><p>
In summary, if you are new to color calibration, you should stick with CTL which offers faster feedback.</p>
