The first thing you should if you want to have a proper color
management workflow is to properly callibrate your monitor.
&nbsp;Accurate monitor calibration requires special equipment to
measure your monitor's display as well as your suroundings.<br>
However, you still obtain a decent monitor calibration if you do it
manually following some simple steps. &nbsp;mrViewer can already help
you with that.<br>



<h3>Geometric distortions</h3>


<p>The first thing you should do after your monitor syncs to the new
video mode is to adjust position and size of the image on the screen.
You can do it either the easy way, using the monitor controls.

</p>
<p>After the size and the position of the image are roughly set, you
should check if there are any<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> geometric distortions and get rid of them if they are present. It's often
impossible to eliminate geometric distortions completely over the
entire image area on older monitors, no matter how hard you try. You fix one thing and
the other one goes wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Finding your monitor's gamma</h3>







<p>
One thing that is puzzling about monitors and tv sets is that they
operate at a different gamma. &nbsp;Basically, due to voltage
limitations in the early days of television (and to also target your
eye's perception more accurately), monitor's screen don't display
images linearly. &nbsp;Instead, they apply a gamma correction to
anything displayed on them. &nbsp;<br><br>Also, by a sheer coincidence, your eyes' perception to luminance is also
nonlinear&nbsp;and happens to also be pretty similar to the gamma
correction&nbsp;a monitor does, so this distortion of luminance often goes
unnoticed. &nbsp;Also, most images meant to be displayed on a tv set or monitor already take this
gamma into account.<br><br>
Roughly speaking, the gamma correction of your monitor is a power function. &nbsp;<br><br>
Different monitors have different gamma settings, so you should check
your monitor's specs. &nbsp; As a general guideline, PC monitors often
use a gamma value between 2.2 and 2.5 while older Mac monitors use a gamma of
1.8. &nbsp;SGI monitors often use a gamma of 1.5.<br><br>
Some advanced modern monitors do not operate using gamma anymore but do
an internal sRGB color correction. &nbsp;sRGB is very similar to a 2.2
gamma function, but its curve is tiny bit different.<br><br>
Scanners, Film&nbsp;and other input sources, on the other
hand, typically have linear signal response to light intensity.<br><br>
These days modern monitors have some plug-and-play capabilities that
may inform your OS about its gamma settings (and other values).
&nbsp;This information is often called EDID and perhaps some tool of
your graphics card can access this information. &nbsp; Currently,
mrViewer does not yet try to read EDID information from your monitor
but your graphics card may have some utility that does. &nbsp; For
example, under Linux and with an NVidia graphics card, nvidia-settings
can often read this information for you.</p><p>
If you don't know your monitor's gamma, you can try to guess it by doing a simple visual test.<br><br>
Make sure mrViewer's gamma and gain are at 1.0 and that no LUT is applied.<br><br>
Open mrViewer and go to the <span class="menu">Reel Window.</span> &nbsp;Then, use the <span class="hotkey">RMB</span> and select <span class="menu">Create-&gt;Linear Gradient</span>.<br>
This will create a simple linear gradient going from totally black to totally white, covering your whole screen. &nbsp;<br>If you look at the values of the pixels, you will see that they change
gradually from 0 to 1. &nbsp;You might want to maximize your window to
see it properly.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>If your monitor uses any type
of gamma, you will see that the gradient's midpoint is not visually at
the center of the screen. &nbsp;This is because of your monitor's
gamma. &nbsp;Using mrViewer's gamma slider, try to adjust it until you
perceive the midpoint to be at the center of the screen, like 0.45, for
example.</p>

<p>
The inverse value of that (ie. 1.0 / gamma setting of mrViewer) is
roughly your monitor's gamma. &nbsp;Thus, if you had to set the slider
to 0.45 or close-by, your monitor's gamma is probably 2.2.<br></p>

<h3>Calibrating your monitor's gain and brightness</h3>

<p>
Now that you know your monitor's gamma, to properly calibrate it, you
then need to use some special image called a gamma chart.
&nbsp;mrViewer already ships with some gamma charts for some common
monitors.<br><br>
Reset mrViewer's gamma and gain back to 1.0.<br><br>
From the Reel Window, do <span class="hotkey">RMB</span> and select <span class="menu">Create-&gt;Gamma Chart-&gt;2.2</span>
(or whatever value is closer to what your monitor uses). &nbsp; This&nbsp;creates &nbsp;a
simple gamma calibration chart for your monitor. &nbsp;Maximize the
view so the chart covers the whole screen. &nbsp; You should then check
that gamma chart from a distance, so that each line blends with each
other. &nbsp;If you don't see the lines blending, you need to adjust
your monitors' brightness and contrast appropriately.</p>

<h3>Calibrating your monitor's colors</h3>Sadly, adjusting your monitor's color balance is much more tricky without a proper sensor.


<p>The color balance controls of the monitor (such as color temperature
or separate RGB gains) adjust relative intensities of the three phosphors,
changing the overall color cast of the displayed image. Higher
temperature setting corresponds to a bluer image, lower temperature -
to a redder image. These controls are intended to match the white
balance of the monitor to the workplace lighting conditions, i.e. make
the white color displayed by monitor match the color of white paper
placed next to it. It is essential for workplace lighting to be
consistent. For best results, your workplace should use daylight-balanced light sources.

</p>
You might also wish to set overall color balance of your monitor at
this time. Color temperature of 5400K is what the daylight is balanced
at, so that's what you should set you monitor color control to. Other
commonly used setting is 6500K. Some monitors default to much cooler
color rendition (9000K and up).<br><br>If
your workplace is next to a window, the sunlight coming from it will
force you to change the color temperature of your monitor as the day
goes by. &nbsp; In a perfect world, your monitor would come with its
own sensor to the environment and adjust automatically, but sadly this
is a technology not yet available.<br><br>If you are able to obtain
information about the three color primaries of your monitor, you can
feed this information to mrViewer in its preferences.</body></html>
