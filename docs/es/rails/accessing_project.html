with your Browser</h1>Depending on whether you have rails setup
to work in development mode or in production mode, the location of
where the web page for your database will vary.<br>During
development, you can find the rails project at the machine's 3000 port.
&nbsp;Once the rails project is deployed, you will find it at the IP
address or web address that you have decided to install it under.<br><br>For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be assuming we are in development mode.<br>

Go to a shell or console window and from rails/assets2d directory of mrViewer type:

<div class="console"><p>> rails server</p></div>

That will print out a number of warnings in several modules.  Ignore them as they are harmless.
Once that is done, if you are currently logged in in the database machine, this
usually means pointing your browser to:<br><br><div class="list">http://localhost:3000/images</div><br>Once
you arrive there, you will be able to navigate to the administration,
shows, sequences, shots, audios, images, videos and categories sections.<br><br>Thus, to access the videos section, you would do:<br><br><div class="list">http://localhost:3000/videos</div><br>
