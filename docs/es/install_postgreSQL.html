must be installed on a server machine. &nbsp;Every machine that
runs mrViewer does not need to have PostgreSQL installed, but will
communicate with the server using TCP/IP with a library that ships with
mrViewer.<br><br>Installing
PostgreSQL means often downloading a binary executable or the source
code from:<br><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">http://www.postgresql.org/</a><br><br>If
you are working on some Unix distribution, you can also probably obtain
a
precompiled version of the database by using your packet manager.
&nbsp;For example, on a Debian distribution, you should be able to
do:<br><br><div class="console"><span style="font-weight: bold;">&gt; apt-get install
postgresql</span><br></div><p>Note: Installing
PostgreSQL on a Windows machine requires the use of an NTFS partition.
</p><p>Once installed, you may want to log in as
administrator and create an administrative account with permissions to
access the database. &nbsp; Often, this user account is called
"postgres" and may have already been created as part of the
installation of the software. &nbsp;This user should have
permissions to create databases. &nbsp;For more information on how
to do this, refer to the postgreSQL manual.</p></body></html>
