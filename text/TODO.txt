	Maya integration

	FLU

	- FLU file requester should really be simplified -- too much
	  ugly code in there.  Use boost::filename

	-----------------

	- Resizing of image information window leads to issues when scrollbar
	  appears

Make a command-line mrViewer's core format -> AVI using ffmpeg.

dependencies.
