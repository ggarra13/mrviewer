BUGS:

	- DEMOREEL2007 jumps to sound.
	  DEMOREEL2007 does not loop correctly and audio becomes out of sync.
	


	FIX NOW !!!
	-----------

	- Stop should rebind images.

	- Seek repeats audio packets? (see cascade_HD - try near 
	  chips 00::20:00) so even a-v will be 1/0, it is still wrong.


	- Reverse playback audio is out of sync ( spiderman.divx ), even
	  with old caching method.

	- Masking has round-off errors.  Try milkgirls with 2.10 Vistavision.

	- Gamma pulldown menu makes hole in opengl window when refreshing.
