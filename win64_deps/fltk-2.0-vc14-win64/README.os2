BUILDING FLTK UNDER OS/2

    The current OS/2 build requires XFree86 for OS/2 to work.  A native
    Presentation Manager version has not been implemented yet
    (volunteers are welcome!).

    To build the XFree86 version of FLTK for OS/2, copy the appropriate
    makeinclude and config files to the main directory and do a make:

        copy makefiles\Makefile.os2x Makefile
	make
