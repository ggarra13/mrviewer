This directory is for the public include files used by fltk. The
directory is named "fltk" so that fltk's source and test programs can
be compiled with these headers by using -I.. as a switch to the
compiler.

FLTK developers: please notice that this is for *PUBLIC* header
files. If you have a private structure that is shared between fltk
source files, put it in the same directory as the source files!
