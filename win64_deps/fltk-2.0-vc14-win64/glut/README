This directory contains GLUT emulation code for fltk.

The demo program "glpuzzle" is almost completely unchanged from the
original glut source code.  Search for "fltk" to find the changes.

The demo program "fractals" shows how a glut program can be imbedded
into a fltk window so that you can add buttons and other controls.
Most of the code is unchanged.  There are reports this program can
crash some OpenGL drivers!

Glut emulation is no longer actively supported in fltk.  However
these files do work and can be used as a starting point for porting
Glut programs.

To compile:

   Make fltk first.  You do not need to install it.

   Type "make" in this directory.

   Try the "glpuzzle" and "fractals" program to test it.

   Type "make install"

To compile Glut source code:

   Modify it so that <glut.h> is replaced with <fltk/glut.h>

   Compile and link with -lfltk2_glut -lfltk2

   You may also need -lglut to get functions like the teapot.  Put
   this *after* -lfltk2.

   You may have to modify the code to get it to compile with C++.
