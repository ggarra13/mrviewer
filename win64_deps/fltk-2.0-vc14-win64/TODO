FLTK 2.0 TODO
-------------

	- Fix configure script and makefiles.
	- fltk::FloatInput/IntInput doesn't return 1 from handle
	  for non-number characters; this means that those
	  characters go to other widgets instead.
	  WAS: this is done on purpose. You can subclass and return
	  1 if you want.
	- fltk::ValueInput buttons don't draw inactive.
	- Inactive widgets get engraved label type???
	- Selection in fltk::Input/InputBrowser is not drawn
	  inactive.
	  WAS: inactive widgets should not have focus so this
	  should not be a problem. However may be a problem for
	  Browser which shows selection even when it does not have focus.
	- fltk::Tabs needs to be updated to use the 1.1.x
	  drawing code.
	  WAS: I personally prefer the diagonal tabs.
	- FLUID widget panel has random widgets in red?
	  WAS: that is supposed to indicate which are set to
	  non-default values, but it may be broken.
	- Need to fix labels/etc. of widget panel.
	- Don't move checkers so slow.
	- strlcat/strlcpy/etc.
