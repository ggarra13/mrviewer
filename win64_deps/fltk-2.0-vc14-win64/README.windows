BUILDING FLTK UNDER MICROSOFT WINDOWS

    There are three ways to build FLTK under Microsoft Windows.  The
    first is to use the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 project files under
    the "ide/visualc" directory.  Just open (or double-click on) the
    "fltk.dsw" file to get the whole shebang.  Use ide/vcnet/fltk.sln
    for Visual C++ 2008, and change the build type of the subprojects
    to remove Cairo if you don't use it.

    The second method is to use Borland C++. Please read the file
    README.bc5 for details.

    The third method is to use the Cygwin or MinGW GNU-based development
    tools. For information on how to build in this environment, please
    read the README.cygwin file.

    Also, you can build windows version of the FLTK library on linux
    using crossbuilding - see also README.mingw32_cross

    Current versions of FLTK may require the winsock2 DLL
    (WS2_32.DLL).  If you have an older version of Windows 95, you may
    not have this DLL and you will have to get it from the Microsoft
    web site.
