\section toc Table of Contents

- <b><a href="files.html">File List</a></b> All FLTK header files that
  define something other than a Class. Different areas of functionality
  are categorized into different header files.

- <b><a href="classes.html">Class List</a></b> All C++ classes and
  structs defined by FLTK header files. In most cases you must include
  the header file &lt;fltk/ClassName.h&gt;, in a few rare cases the
  class is defined in one of the <a href="files.html">above</a> header
  files.

- <b><a href="hierarchy.html">Class Hierarchy</a></b> Same list of
  classes and structs, but arranged by inheritance.

- <b><a href="functions.html">Class Members</a></b> A list of all
  class members (methods, variables, enumerations, etc.) by name,
  with the class they are defined in. Useful when you see a method
  being called but are not sure what the class is.

- <b><a href="globals.html">File Members</a></b> A list of all
  functions, enumerations, variables, etc., that are not members
  of classes, with the header file they are defined in.

- <b><a href="pages.html">Related Pages</a></b> Tutorial by example of
  how to write programs using FLTK, how to run Fluid, emulation of
  older FLTK and of other toolkits, and various other subjects.

\section fltk namespace fltk

All classes and functions for running the user interface are in the
\link fltk fltk:: namespace \endlink . Some utility functions such as in \link string.h
<fltk/string.h> \endlink are \e not in this namespace.

Put <code>using namespace fltk;</code> after the include files, and you
will not need to put the "fltk::" in front of everything.

Fltk1.1 emulation is mostly achieved by aliasing the old class name
"Fl" to this namespace so that the static methods in Fltk1.1 will
work, and by typedefs from the new fltk::Widget class names to the
older Fl_Widget class names.
