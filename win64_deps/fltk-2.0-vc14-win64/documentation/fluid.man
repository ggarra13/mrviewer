.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
fluid \fI[-c [-o code-filename -h header-filename]] [filename.fl]\fR 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIfluid\fR is an interactive GUI designer for FLTK. When run with no
arguments a new, empty program is started. When run with a filename,
\fIfluid\fR opens that existing program. Fluid will display the GUI
hierarchy and any windows defined in the file. Functions, classes,
windows, and GUI components can be manipulated as needed.
.LP
When used with the \fI-c\fR option and a filename, \fIfluid\fR will
create the necessary C++ header and code files in the current
directory, and then exit. This can be used in Makefiles to "compile"
fluid input.  You can override the default extensions, filenames, and
directories using the \fI-o\fR and \fI-h\fR options.
