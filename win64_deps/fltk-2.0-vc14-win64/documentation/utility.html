<h1>The FLTK "Environement"</h1>

Fltk provides enough "environment" functions that the demo programs
can be made to work. Unlike other toolkits, fltk tries to sepearte the
user environment from the actual widgets: these functions are for
convienence only, they are not really part of the core of fltk.  If
you don't like the way they look, copy the code and modify to to what
you want. Most likely any real environment built atop fltk, such as
FLEK, will replace all these functions.

<h2><a name=args>Argument parser</a></h2>

<h4><a name="args">int fltk::args(int argc, char **argv, int &amp;i, int (*callback)(int, char**,int &amp;)=0)</a></h4>

FLTK provides an <I>entirely optional</I> command-line switch parser. 
You don't have to call it if you don't like them! Everything it can do 
can be done with other calls to FLTK. 

<p>To use the switch parser, call <a
href="#args"><tt>fltk::args(...)</tt></a> near the start of your program.
This does <I>not</I> open the display, instead switches that need the
display open are stashed into static variables.  Then you <I>must</I>
display your first window by calling <a href="Fl_Window.html#show">
window-&gt;show(argc,argv)</a>, which will do anything stored in the
static variables.</p>

<p><tt>callback</tt> lets you define your own switches.  It is called 
with the same <tt>argc</tt> and <tt>argv</tt>, and with <tt>i</tt> the 
index of each word. The callback should return zero if the switch is 
unrecognized, and not change <tt>i</tt>.  It should return non-zero if 
the switch is recognized, and add at least 1 to <tt>i</tt> (it can add 
more to consume words after the switch).  This function is called 
<i>before</i> any other tests, so <i>you can override any FLTK
switch</i> (this is why fltk can use very short switches instead of
the long ones all other toolkits force you to use).</p>
<p>On return <tt>i</tt> is set to the index of the first non-switch. 
This is either:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first word that does not start with '-'.</li>
<li>The word '-' (used by many programs to name stdin as a file)</li>
<li>The first unrecognized switch (return value is 0).</li>
<li><tt>argc</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>The return value is <tt>i</tt> unless an unrecognized switch is found, 
in which case it is zero.  If your program takes no arguments other 
than switches you should produce an error if the return value is less 
than <tt>argc</tt>. 

<p>All switches may be abbreviated one letter and case is ignored:

<p><ul>

<li><tt>-display host:n.n</tt> The X display to use (ignored  under 
WIN32).</li>

<li><tt>-geometry WxH</tt> Window is resized to this width & height</li>
<li><tt>-geometry +X+Y</tt> Initial window position</li>
<li><tt>-geometry WxH+X+Y</tt> Window is resized and positioned.</li>

<li><tt>-name string</tt> <a
href="x.html#xclass">fltk::Window::xclass(string)</a> will be
done to the window, possibly changing its icon.</li>

<li><tt>-title string</tt> <a
href="Fl_Window.html#label">fltk::Window::label(string)</a> will be done
to the window, changing both its title and the icontitle.</li>

<li><tt>-iconic</tt> <a
href="Fl_Window.html#iconize">fltk::Window::iconize()</a> will be done to
the window.</li>

<li><tt>-bg color</tt> XParseColor is used to lookup the passed color
and then <a href="Fl_Color.html#background">fltk::background()</a> is
done.  Under WIN32 only color names of the form &quot;#xxxxxx&quot;
are understood.</li>

<li><tt>-theme name</tt> NYI. Names a plugin that fltk will load
automatically and set the <a href="theme.html#theme">fltk::theme()</a>
pointer to any function in the plugin called "fltk_theme". ".theme" is
added to the name to get the filename of the plugin, and if it
does not start with a slash it is tried relative to "~/.fltk".

<li><tt>-scheme name</tt> NYI. This string is stored and theme plugins
can refer to it and use it to alter their behavior. Typically it is
used to name a file the theme reads.

</ul>

<h4>void fltk::args(int argc, char **argv)</h4>

The second form of <tt>fltk::args()</tt> is useful if your program does
not have command line switches of its own.  It parses all the
switches, and if any are not recognized it calls <a
href="Fl.html#fatal"><tt>fltk::fatal(fltk::help)</tt></a>.

<h4><a name="arg">int fltk::arg(int argc, char **argv, int &amp;i)</a></h4>

Consume a single switch from <tt>argv</tt>, starting at word i. 
Returns the number of words eaten (1 or 2, or 0 if it is not 
recognized) and adds the same value to <tt>i</tt>.  You can use this 
function if you prefer to control the incrementing through the 
arguments yourself. 

<h4><a name="help">const char* const fltk::help;</a></h4>

This is the usage string that is displayed if <a
href="#args"><tt>fltk::args()</tt></a> detects an invalid argument on
the command-line. It's value is:

<pre>
" -d[isplay] host:n.n\n"
" -g[eometry] WxH+X+Y\n"
" -n[ame] windowname\n"
" -i[conic]\n"
" -bg color";
</pre>

<h2><a name=ucolor>Color Choosers</a></h2>

<H4><A name=color_chooser>int fltk::color_chooser(const char*, double 
&amp;r, double &amp;g, double &amp;b)
<BR> int fltk::color_chooser(const char *, uchar &amp;r, uchar &amp;g, uchar &amp;b)</A>
</H4>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG src=./fl_color_chooser.jpg></p>

<p><tt>fltk::color_chooser()</tt> pops up a window to let the user pick
an arbitrary RGB color.  They can pick the hue and saturation in the
&quot;hue box&quot; on the left (hold down CTRL to just change the
saturation), and the brighness using the vertical slider.  Or they can
type the 8-bit numbers into the RGB <A
href=Fl_Value_Input.html><tt>fltk::ValueInput</tt></A> fields, or drag
the mouse across them to adjust them.  The pull-down menu lets the
user set the input fields to show RGB, HSV, or 8-bit RGB (0 to
255).</p>

<p>This returns non-zero if the user picks ok, and updates the RGB 
values.  If the user picks cancel or closes the window this returns 
zero and leaves RGB unchanged.</p>

<p>The double version takes and returns RGB values in the range 0.0 to
1.0.  The uchar version takes RGB values in the range 0 to 255.

<p>If you use the color chooser on an 8-bit screen, it will allocate 
all the available colors, leaving you no space to exactly represent the 
color the user picks!  You can however use <A href=drawing.html#rectf><tt>
fltk::rectf()</tt></A> to fill a region with a simulated color using 
dithering.</p>

<H4><A name=show_colormap>int fltk::show_colormap(int oldcol)</A></H4>

<tt>fltk::show_colormap()</tt> pops up a panel of the 256 colors you can 
access with "indexed" <A href=Fl_Color.html><tt>fltk::Color</tt></A>
values and lets the user pick one of them.  It returns the new color
index, or the old one if the user types ESC or clicks outside the window. 

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG src=./fl_show_colormap.gif></p>

<h2><a name=upopup>Popup messages and questions</a></h2>

<H4><A name=message>void fltk::message(const char *, ...)</A></H4>

Displays a printf-style message in a pop-up box with an &quot;OK&quot; button, 
waits for the user to hit the button.  The message will wrap to fit the 
window, or may be many lines by putting <tt>\n</tt> characters into it. 
The enter key is a shortcut for the OK button. 

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG src=./fl_message.gif></p>

<H4><A name=alert>void fltk::alert(const char *, ...)</A></H4>

Same as <tt>fltk::message()</tt> except for the &quot;!&quot; symbol. 

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG src=./fl_alert.gif></p>

<H4><A name=ask>int fltk::ask(const char *, ...)</A></H4>

Displays a printf-style message in a pop-up box with an
&quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; button and waits for the user to
hit a button.  The return value is 1 if the user hits Yes, 0 if they
pick No.  The enter key is a shortcut for Yes and ESC is a shortcut
for No.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG src=./fl_ask.gif></p>

<H4><A name=choice>int fltk::choice(const char *q, const char *b0, 
const char *b1, const char *b2, ...)</A></H4>

Shows the message with three buttons below it marked with the strings
<tt> b0</tt>, <tt>b1</tt>, and <tt>b2</tt>.  Returns 0, 1, or 2
depending on which button is hit. If one of the strings begins with
the special character '*' then the associated button will be the default
which is selected when the enter key is pressed.  ESC is a shortcut for
button 0.  Notice the buttons are positioned &quot;backwards&quot; You
can hide buttons by passing <tt>NULL</tt> as their labels.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG src=./fl_choice.gif></p>

<H4><A name=input>const char *fltk::input(const char *label, const char 
*deflt = 0, ...)</A></H4>

Pops up a window displaying a string, lets the user edit it, and 
return the new value.  The cancel button returns <tt>NULL</tt>. <I>The 
returned pointer is only valid until the next time <tt>fltk::input()</tt>
is called</I>.  Due to back-compatability, the arguments to any printf 
commands in the label are after the default value. 

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG src=./fl_input.gif></p>

<H4><A name=password>const char *fltk::password(const char *label, 
const char *deflt = 0, ...)</A></H4>

Same as <tt>fltk::input()</tt> except an <A href=Fl_Secret_Input.html>
<tt>fltk::SecretInput</tt></A> field is used.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG src=./fl_password.gif></p>

<H4><A name=message_font>void fltk::message_font(fltk::Font, int size)</A></H4>

Change the font and font size used for the messages in all the popups. 

<H4><A name=message_icon>void fltk::message_icon(fltk::Widget *)</A></H4>

Sets the widget that will be displayed as the icon for all the popups.  Any
widget with any label can be created and used as the icon, including widgets
with callbacks! Calling this function with <tt>NULL</tt> will reset the
icons to the FLTK default.

<h2><a name=ufilechooser>File Chooser</a></h2>
 
<h4><a name=file_chooser>char *fltk::file_chooser(const char * message, 
const char *pattern, const char *fname)</a></h4>

FLTK provides a &quot;tab completion&quot; file chooser that makes it easy to 
choose files from large directories.  This file chooser has several 
unique features, the major one being that the Tab key completes 
filenames like it does in Emacs or tcsh, and the list always shows all 
possible completions. 

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG src=./filechooser.gif></p>

<tt>fltk::file_chooser()</tt> pops up the file chooser, waits for the user 
to pick a file or Cancel, and then returns a pointer to that filename 
or <tt>NULL</tt> if Cancel is chosen. 

<p><tt>message</tt> is a string used to title the window.</p>

<p><tt>pattern</tt> is used to limit the files listed in a directory to 
those matching the pattern.  This matching is done by <A href=#filename_match>
<tt>filename_match()</tt></A>.  Use <tt>NULL</tt> to show all files.</p>

<p><tt>fname</tt> is a default filename to fill in the chooser with. 
 If this is <tt>NULL</tt> then the last filename that was choosen is 
used (unless that had a different pattern, in which case just the last 
directory with no name is used).  The first time the file chooser is 
called this defaults to a blank string.</p>

<p>The returned value points at a static buffer that is only good until 
the next time <tt>fltk::file_chooser()</tt> is called.</p>

<H4><A name=file_chooser_callback>void fltk::file_chooser_callback(void 
(*cb)(const char *))</A></H4>

Set a function that is called every time the user clicks a file in the 
currently popped-up file chooser.  This could be used to preview the 
contents of the file.  It has to be reasonably fast, and cannot create 
FLTK windows. 

<H4><A name=filename_list>int filename_list(const char *d, dirent 
***list)</A></H4>

This is a portable and const-correct wrapper for the
<tt>fltk::scandir</tt> function. <tt>d</tt> is the name of a directory
(it does not matter if it has a trailing slash or not).  For each file
in that directory a &quot;dirent&quot; structure is created.  The only
portable thing about a dirent is that dirent.d_name is the
nul-terminated file name.  An array of pointers to these dirents is
created and a pointer to the array is returned in <tt>*list</tt>.  The
number of entries is given as a return value.  If there is an error
reading the directory a number less than zero is returned, and
<tt>errno</tt> has the reason (<tt>errno</tt> does not work under
WIN32).  The files are sorted in &quot;alphanumeric&quot; order, where
an attempt is made to put unpadded numbers in consecutive order.

<p>You can free the returned list of files with the following code:</p>

<PRE>for (int i = return_value; i &gt; 0;) free((void*)(list[--i]));
free((void*)list);</PRE>

<H4><A name=filename_isdir>int filename_isdir(const char *f)</A></H4>

Returns non-zero if the file exists and is a directory. 

<H4><A name=filename_name>const char *filename_name(const char *f)</A></H4>

Returns a pointer to the character after the last slash, or to the 
start of the filename if there is none. 

<H4><A name=filename_ext>const char *filename_ext(const char *f)</A></H4>

Returns a pointer to the last period in <tt>filename_name(f)</tt>, or 
a pointer to the trailing nul if none. 

<H4><A name=filename_setext>char *filename_setext(char *f, const char 
*ext)</A></H4>

Does <tt>strcpy(filename_ext(f), ext ? ext : &quot;&quot;)</tt>.  Returns a 
pointer to <tt>f</tt>. 

<H4><A name=filename_expand>int filename_expand(char *out, const char
*in)</A></H4>

Splits <tt>in</tt> at each slash character.  Replaces any occurrance 
of <tt>$X</tt> with <tt>getenv(&quot;X&quot;)</tt> (leaving it as <tt>$X</tt> if 
the environment variable does not exist).  Replaces any occurances of <tt>
~X</tt> with user <tt>X</tt>'s home directory (leaving it as <tt>~X</tt>
if the user does not exist).  Any resulting double slashes cause 
everything before the second slash to be deleted.  Copies the result to <tt>
out</tt> (<tt>in</tt> and <tt>out</tt> may be the same buffer). 
Returns non-zero if any changes were made. <I>In true retro 
programming style, it is up to you to provide a buffer big enough for 
the result.  1024 characters should be enough.</I>

<H4><A name=filename_absolute>int filename_absolute(char *out, const 
char *in)</A></H4>

If <tt>in</tt> does not start with a slash, this prepends the current 
working directory to <tt>in</tt> and then deletes any occurances of <tt>
.</tt> and x/.. from the result, which it copies to <tt>out</tt> (<tt>in</tt>
and <tt>out</tt> may be the same buffer).  Returns non-zero if any 
changes were made. <I>In true retro programming style, it is up to you 
to provide a buffer big enough for the result.  1024 characters should 
be enough.</I>

<H4><A name=filename_match>int filename_match(const char *f, const char 
*pattern)</A></H4>

Returns true if <tt>f</tt> matches <tt>pattern</tt>.  The following 
syntax is used by <tt>pattern</tt>: 

<UL>
<LI><tt>*</tt> matches any sequence of 0 or more characters.</LI>
<LI><tt>?</tt> matches any single character.</LI>
<LI><tt>[set]</tt> matches any character in the set.  Set  can contain 
any single characters, or a-z to represent a range.  To  match ] or - 
they must be the first characters.  To match ^ or ! they  must not be 
the first characters.</LI>
<LI><tt>[^set] or <B>[!set]</B></tt> matches any character  not in the 
set.</LI>
<LI><tt>{X|Y|Z} or <B>{X,Y,Z}</B></tt> matches any one of  the 
subexpressions literally.</LI>
<LI><tt>\x</tt> quotes the character x so it has no special  meaning.</LI>
<LI><tt>x</tt> all other characters must be matched exactly.</LI>
</UL>
