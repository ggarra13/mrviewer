/*! \page example2 Example 2: Using Callbacks

Every widget in fltk has a single \link fltk::Widget::callback
callback function\endlink. Fltk assumes that for any type of widget,
there is exactly one "interesting" thing it does, such as the value
inside it being changed, or the user changing what is selected, or for
buttons the user pushing them.

For the Window, the "interesting" thing it does is the user trying to
close it by pressing the close box. By default this closes the
window. Lets change the callback in the \ref example1 "hello" program so
this does something different:

\include helloask.cxx

The window is exactly the same, but when you press the close box it
will display this question box:

\image html fl_ask.gif

If the user hits the Yes button the window will be closed (by calling
fltk::Window::hide()) and the program will exit (because fltk::run()
will return when all the windows are hidden). If the user hits the No
button then the question box goes away and nothing happens.

Lets look at all the changes between this program and the previous
one:

\code
#include <fltk/ask.h>
\endcode

This line was added so that we can call the fltk::ask() function.

\code
void window_callback(Widget* widget, void*) {
  if (ask("Do you really want to exit?"))
    ((Window*)widget)->hide();
}
\endcode

This is the function that will be called when the user hits the
closebox. All callbacks are of this type. The first argument is the
Widget that the callback is for, and the second argument arbitrary
data that the calling program can store in a Widget with
fltk::Widget::user_data(void*). We are not using this data here.

This callback pops up a question box and waits for the answer by
calling fltk::ask(). It returns true if the user hits Yes.

If the user hits yes, we call hide() on the window.  Because setting
the callback is a method on the base Widget class, it has to be
declared to take a Widget. We know this is a Window so it is safe to
do the type cast shown here. (It would also be possible to declare this
function as taking a Window and casting the function type when setting
the callback, Fluid does this. We could add inline methods to Window
to do this casting, but doing it correctly when there are multiple
levels of base classes results in unreadable header files.)

Why are there two arguments? Isn't the second one the same as
widget->user_data()? In most cases this is true. However having the
separate arguments allows you to declare the function as taking the
correct type and casting it when setting the callback. It also allows
Menus and Browsers to execute the widgets inside them in a way that is
convenient: the widget argument is the Menu, the callback is from the
actual item, and the data will be from the item unless it is zero, in
which case it is from the Menu.

\code
window->callback(window_callback);
\endcode

After the window is created this line sets the callback function.

\section buttons Making Widgets talk to each other

Here is a more realistic example where there are several widgets and
they communicate with each other:

\include callbacks.cxx

Running this gives you a window containing a text input field, a
slider, and several buttons:

\image html callbacks.gif

At the top of the program are several callback functions. These update
the text field through the static pointer <tt>intinput</tt> and update
the slider by using the user_data pointer to point to it (except for
the slider_callback itself, which uses the Widget argument). See the
next chapter for how to use classes to avoid such kludges to keep
track of the pointers.
