Project files for Bloodshed Dev-C++

FLTK USERS
----------
Since Dev-C++ does not support workspaces,
be sure to compile projects in following order:
 1. FLTK.dev
 2. FLTK_Images.dev
 3. - n. rest of projects

DEVELOPERS
----------
IMHO we shouldn't commit .layout and *_private* files
to FLTK SVN/CVS repository. This should be discussed on
fltk.devel ...
