This directory contains Forms/XForms emulation code for fltk.
This includes emulation of most of the functions in the forms.h header
file, and special Fl_Widgets that replicate the forms ones.

The demo program "colbrowser" is an XForms program with minimal
changes needed to make it work.  The demo program "forms" is an even
older Forms program with minimal changes.

Forms emulation is no longer actively supported in fltk.  However
these files do work and can be used as a starting point for porting
Forms code.

Some portions of Forms/XForms emulation are still in the main source
code, such as the HIDDEN button types.  We are trying to gradually
remove these.

To compile:

   Make fltk first.  You do not need to install it.

   Type "make" in this directory.

   Try the "forms" program to test it.

   Type "make install"

To compile Forms/XForms source code:

   Modify it so that <forms.h> is replaced with <fltk/forms.h>

   Compile and link with -lfltk2_forms -lfltk2
