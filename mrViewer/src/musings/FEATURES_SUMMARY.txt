FEATURES
--------

- and x  Already working or in beta.

(++) Expected for a commercial 1.5 release.
(*)  Planned feature for a 2.0 release.
(**) Planned feature for a 2.5/3.0 release.


General
-------

- Multi-platform ( Windows, Linux )
- Viewer works internally in linear floating point.
- Fully Multithreaded. 
- OpenGL acceleration on any low-end graphics card (*ANY* low end 
  GeForce or Quadro).  No need for a graphics card with pixel shaders.
- Automatic detection of graphics card features for improved performance
  Better the gfx card, better the performance/features done in real-time
- Arbitrary 1/10 - x32 Zoom with auto-centering on mouse location.
- Usage through command-line, GUI, drag and drop, file associations
  and through reel playlists.
- DAG streaming capabilities (add video/audio filters, etc) (*)


Display
-------

- Full-screen and Presentation modes.
- ICC/ICM profiles for proper emulation of any media on your monitor.  
  Allows you to emulate Film, Print, or Video conditions using a
  combination of 33x33x33 color lattice, 2D LUTS and color matrix 
  transforms.
  Each image and sequence can have its own ICC profile, in addition
  to your monitor ICC profile.
- Fast dithered 8-bit quantization for display, avoids banding
  when displaying floating point or HDR images on 8-bit displays.
- Channel Display:
	* Color
	* Red
	* Green
	* Blue
	* Alpha
	* Alpha Overlay
	* Luminance
	* Any PSD / RPF / XCF / OpenEXR / IFF / mental ray layer


Color Features
--------------

- Fast Gain, F-Stop and Gamma controls.
- Real-time color corrections under some gfx cards (++)
- Pixel Values display: RGBA, HSV, Luminance.
- Pixel Area Values Display: Maximum, Minimum, Average in RGBA/HSVL.
- Image channel normalization onto [0,1] range for display of
  shadow maps and depth channels.
- Histogram
- Digital Vectorscope


Command-line
------------

- Multiple valid image sequence syntaxes:
  seq.@@@.iff 1-120
  seq.1-120.iff 
  seq.%04d.iff 1-120
- If frame range is not provided, it is guessed from images on disk.
- Proper cygwin path support.


Images
------

- Support for arbitrary number of channels and layers. 
- Image sequence support with or without padding with automatic 
  detection of ranges.
- Multiple image/sequence storage.
- Image thumbnail previews.
- Caching of image sequences in memory for playback.
- Automatic re-loading and updating of images as they change on disk.
- Image information with directory, filename, resolution, bit depth, 
  gamma, pixel ratio, compression, line order, frame ranges, color
  profile, number of layers, and video and audio stream information.
- EXIF file information support as provided by most digital photo
  cameras.  Allows you to obtain aperture, shutter, etc. - viewer uses
  that information to set fstop automatically.  This information is editable.
- IPTC file information support as provided by some newspapers and other
  news outlets.  This information is also editable.
- Automatic pixel ratio detection, pixel ratio compensation and
  frame rate selection for common PAL/NTSC/HDTV resolutions.
- Automatic baking of image sequences when gain, gamma, icc
  profile or layer display changes.


Video
-----

- Quicktime/AVI/MPEG/OGG support.  Partial WMV support.
  Full WMV support (*)
- Playback supports scrubbing, looping, ping-pong and EDL.
- Arbitrary frame rate playback for slow motion, rewinding 
  and fast forwarding with audio.
- Timeline display as frames, timecode and reel edits (EDL).
- Playback of Quicktime/AVI files in reels (EDL) for digital dailies,
  limited only by memory.
- Multiple Reels (EDL) support. 
- Reels support re-sorting images using drag&drop.
- Frame and Field display/playback.
- Safe Action and Title Area display for 4:3 Video and HDTV. 
  Safe Action for Film's 1.85:1 and 1.66:1 formats.
- Built-in generation of SMPTE color bars and gamma charts across 
  3 brightness levels for monitor calibration.
- Automatic slate generation (*)


Audio
-----

- Support for multiple audio tracks in AVI movies.
- Each image sequence can have an optional .wav or .mp3 file attached 
  for music/lip-sync.


Render Features
---------------

- Automatic non-destructive compositing of foreground renders over 
  background images with proper scaling for preview rendering.
- Arbitrary display and update of all mental ray frame buffers
  in full float precision while rendering.
- Cloning and dating of cloned images for versioning of renders.
- Viewer window remains always on top of other applications.
- Hooks to mrLiquid and any other mental ray pipeline
  rather seamlessly.
- Time stamp with approximate render time (mental ray).


Dailies
-------

- Annotations    (*)
- Grease Marker  (*)
- Remote Dailies (*)


Asset Tracking
--------------

- Automatic logging of each image, sequence, video and audio
  into a PostgreSQL database. (++)
- RubyOnRails html web page for easily searching and listing of image
  assets.                     (++)
- AJAX Searching for immediate results and completions.
- Secure Connections with optional Authentications. (*)
- FTPS (Secure) uploading of assets onto ftp server. (*)
- FTPS (Secure) downloading of assets for remote collaboration. (*)


Scripting (*)
