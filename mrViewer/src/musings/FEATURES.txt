FEATURES
--------

- and x  Already working or in beta.

(+) Expected for a commercial 1.0 release.
(*) Planned feature for a 2.0 release.
(#) Planned feature for a 3.0 or later release.


General
-------

- Multi-platform ( Windows, Linux )
- Viewer works internally in linear floating point.
- Fully Multithreaded. 
- OpenGL acceleration on any low-end graphics card (*ANY* low end GeForce or 
  Quadro).
  No need for a graphics card with pixel shaders.
  (*) For v1.0, there will probably be another version 
  of the software specifically taking advantage of the latest 
  GFX cards (NVidia GForce 7 line, etc).
- Arbitrary 1/10 - x32 Zoom with auto-centering on mouse location.
- Usage through command-line, GUI, drag and drop, file associations
  and through reel playlists.


Display
-------

- Full-screen and Presentation modes.
- ICC/ICM profiles for proper emulation of any media on your monitor.  
  Allows you to emulate Film, Print, or Video conditions using a
  combination of 33x33x33 color lattice, 2D LUTS and color matrix 
  transforms.
  Each image and sequence can have its own ICC profile, in addition
  to your monitor ICC profile.
- Fast dithered 8-bit quantization for display, avoids banding
  when displaying floating point or HDR images on 8-bit displays.
- Channel Display:
	* Color
	* Red
	* Green
	* Blue
	* Alpha
	* Alpha Overlay
	* Luminance
	* Any PSD / RPF / XCF / OpenEXR / IFF / mental ray layer


Color Features
--------------

- Pixel Area Values Display: Maximum, Minimum, Average in RGBA/HSVL.
- Image channel normalization onto [0,1] range for display of
  shadow maps and depth channels.
- Histogram
- Vectorscope


Command-line
------------

- Support for shake (seq.@@@.iff 1-120), ilm (seq.1-120.iff) and 
  nuke (seq.%04d.iff 1-120) image sequence syntaxes.
- If frame range is not provided, it is guessed from images on disk.

  gamma, pixel ratio, compression, line order, frame ranges, color
  profile, number of layers, and video and audio stream information.
- EXIF file information support as provided by most digital photo
  cameras.  Allows you to obtain aperture, shutter, etc. - viewer uses
  that information to set fstop automatically.
- Automatic pixel ratio detection, pixel ratio compensation and
  frame rate selection for common PAL/NTSC/HDTV resolutions.
- Automatic baking of image sequences when gain, gamma, icc
  profile or layer display changes.


Video
-----

- Playback supports scrubbing, looping, ping-pong and EDL.
- Arbitrary frame rate playback for slow motion, rewinding 
  and fast forwarding with audio.

  limited only by memory.
- Multiple Reels (EDL) support.

  Safe Action for Film's 1.85:1 and 1.66:1 formats.
- Built-in generation of SMPTE color bars and gamma charts across 
  3 brightness levels for monitor calibration.


Audio
-----

- Support for multiple audio tracks in AVI movies.
- Each image sequence can have an optional .wav or .mp3 file attached 
  for music/lip-sync.


Render Features
---------------

- Automatic non-destructive compositing of foreground renders over 
  background image with proper scaling for preview rendering.
- Arbitrary display and update of all mental ray frame buffers
  in full float precision while rendering.
- Cloning and dating of cloned images for versioning of renders.
- Viewer window remains always on top of other applications.
- Hooks to mrLiquid and any other mental ray pipeline rather seamlessly.
- Time stamp with approximate render time (mental ray).
- Stereoscopic Playback (#)


Dailies
-------

- Annotations    (*)
- Grease Marker  (*)
- Remote Dailies (*)
- A True EDL Timeline (#)

  assets.
- Secure and Transparent Server connections for remote collaboration (*)

Patents/Licensing Issues
------------------------

- ALL Libraries used are LGPL, not GPL.
- AVI supports MPEG-4 x264 compressor.  Patent applies only if sales 
  reach 100,000 or more.
- DDS supports the now somewhat obsolete S3TC compression.
  This patent is still in effect, but ATI's free 3Dc compression
  offers better compression with no patent issues.


==============================



Known Bugs
----------

- HTML Documentation is still incomplete.
- Floating point IFFs are read wrong.
- 3PS decompressor decompresses additional layers incorrectly.
  Z decompresses ok.
- Tiled MAP files are read improperly.
- Changing FPS on Quicktime movies does not do anything.
- Comping of front layer over moving sequence is not realtime.
- PDF with multiple pages can take forever to load.
- Softimage PIC files are saved without RLE compression.
- EXR is saved in full float, no option to save in half.
- Progress bar displays text in black, not widget color.
- No IFF, MAP, RPF, DDS savers yet.
