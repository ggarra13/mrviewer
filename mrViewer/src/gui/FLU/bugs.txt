- cancel does not cancel the first time around.  The cancelCB is called later.
  Not sure why.

- scroll_to in filedetails is not doing anything -- browser issue?  not 
  understanding it.  display(index) works ok, but does not  move scrollbar.
  even when scrollbar is moved, it still does not display in right place.
  something is resetting yposition()???
- creating multiple folders one after the other leaves them 
  unnamed (uncreated?)
- groups in location tree cannot be selected (Escritorio) --- hard to FIX

- Flu_Separator missing

- browser details' vertical scrollbar is not filling header, it should --
  or header's last column is not filling width


To add:
- Autocompletion as you type filename/switch
- Pressing TAB should switch from listing all files to listing options
- Hiding .dot files/Show hidden files switch
- Add to favorites needs to indicate that something happened
