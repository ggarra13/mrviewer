v3.0.0   - Bug fixed alpha in shaders for stereo display.  Previously
	   a border would surround images.
	 - Bug fixed main Rectangle class.  Previously it could not
	   merge properly.
	 - Made display_window and data_window functions take a frame.
	   This avoids sporadic flashes when loading images.
	 - Avoided recaching on stereo modes when images have been 
	   loaded.
	 - Made EDL cuts more seamless.
	 - Avoided a crash when in anaglyph mode and the sources had
	   different size.
	 - Avoided a crash when in stereo mode after crossed stereo.

v2.9.9   - Added stereo interlaced, interlaced columns and 
	   checkerboard.
	 - Fixed color queries to support stereo interlaced and
	   checkerboard.
	 - Added saving and loading of stereo images in reels.
	 - Added option to load stereo image on an already loaded
	   image.
	 - Added youtube videos to documentation.
	 - Fixed cache line in timeline when in EDL mode and 
	   with edits.

v2.9.8   - Bug fixed OpenEXR reader for multipart image files that
	   are not stereo images.  Previously the files would show
	   the first part only.
	 - The new audio sync was failing on VOBs.  Changed it to
	   make it work.
	 - The win32 release was crashing on file requester due
	   to wrong ffmpeg libraries.  Fixed.

v2.9.7   - Allowed command-line loading of stereo images/movies
	   without any prefix.  The syntax is using the -s keyword:

	   	   mrViewer -s leftimage.1.exr -s rightimage.1.exr

         - Updated media information's value and sliders to trigger
	   an update of the slider if the value is typed in.
	 - Added license and configuration information of ffmpeg
	   to the About window.
	 - Reverted an audio optimization which would create problems
	   in audio playback when loops happened early and audio
	   packets decoded into multiple frames.
	 - Reverted a video optimization which was creating problems
	   in reverse playback.
	 - Improved video playback when scrubbing which was skipping
	   some frames incorrectly.  This change should remove all
	   warnings of missing video frames.
	 - Improved audio sync after seeks and in normal mode for
	   Linux and Windows64.
	 - Bug fixed adjusting of EDL when stereo was on.
	 - Made music only tracks not report an invalid index for
	   channel selection.
	 - Removed stereo interlaced as it was not working properly.
	 - Bug fixed unshown frames counter when playing backwards.

v2.9.6   - Made channel selection work with toggles more intuitively.
	   Going to N.x with a 'r' hotkey and then pressing 'r' 
	   again will bring you back to "N", not "Color" as before.
	 - Made channel selection smarter to avoid reloads when
	   not needed.  Only switching full layers or multiparts
	   will cause reloads now.
	 - Fixed Unshown Frames (UF:) in Hud Display to correctly
	   count unshown frames.  Previously it would count them
	   with an addition of one to it each time.
	 - Fixed a random crash that would happen when LUT was 
	   activated and the sequence was still being loaded.
	 - Fixed color picker not showing the right colors on
	   stereo images once cache was cleared.
	 - Fixed a memory leak of thumbnail pictures.
	 - Added an elapsed and remaining timings to saving
	   a sequence or a movie.
	 - Bug fixed Saving of OpenGL Snapshots for a sequence of
	   images.  Previously it would crash.

v2.9.5   - Improved OpenEXR loader by a factor of 2.
	 - Made OpenEXR saver default to PIZ wavelet compression,
	   instead of None.
	 - Made audio track selection not throw when invalid tracks
	   are used.  If an invalid track is used, the audio is
	   muted ( track is -1 ).
	 - Same thing with subtitle track.
	 - Bug fixed Media Info Window not updating on frame change.
	 - Made images saved with left. or right. prefix not change 
	   to %V. prefix automatically.

v2.9.4   - RMB->Pixel->Copy Pixel Value now respects lut and
	   gamma if active.
	 - Changing volume or audio track now effects both 
	   stereo images.
	 - Bug fixed avi saver to work with images whose
	   resolution is not a multiple of two.
	 - Bug fixed thumbnail creation when image is not
	   a multiple of two.
	 - Bug fixed gaps in cache that would appear in timeline
	   when playing in loop.
	 - Updated to latest ffmpeg version.
	 - Changed 'o' alpha overlay shortcut to 'v', to avoid clash
	   with 'o' in changing timeline out point.
	 - Made channel list work with submenus, for easier access
	   and less clutter.
	 - Added stereo interlaced to show images interlaced.  For
	   this to work it is necessary to be in zoom 1.0 or
	   presentation mode.
	 - Bug fixed installation on Linux relying on symlinks.

v2.9.3   - Bug fixed saving of OpenExr files when data window was
	   smaller than display window.  Previously it would crash.
	 - Bug fixed a number of memory leaks.
	 - Bug fixed fit image when in stereo side by side mode.
	 - Bug fixed saving of files in start directory instead of
	   directory set in file requester.
	 - Added support for stereo loading of two set of images
	   or two sets of movie files with a common prefix.  The
	   syntax is a single letter prefix or a full keyword:
	   Examples:
	   	  rootname.prefix.number.extension
		  da20.L.0001.exr
		  da20.R.0001.exr
           For movies:
		  rootname.prefix.extension
		  da20.left.mov
		  da20.right.mov

           In the file requester, the movies and sequences
	   will appear as:
	      	  da20.%v.mov      # for da20.L|R.mov
		  da20.%V.%04d.exr # for da20.left|right.0001.exr

	   The names of left and right and L and R can be changed
	   with environment variables. See documentation.

	   Current Limitations
	   -------------------
	   Currently, it is not possible to mix a movie and a
	   sequence in stereo viewing.
	   It is also not possible to view in stereo channels
	   other than RGBA.
	   Finally, a background image is available for
	   the left eye only.

v2.9.2   - Bug fixed removing a directory from Favorites.
	 - Removed all database functions as noone was using them and
	   they remained under developed.  As a result of this,
	   opening files is much faster now.
	 - Added Unix-like permissions to file details in file 
	   requester.
	 - Made file requester column labels appear translated in 
	   Spanish locale.
	 - Added a Preload Cache option to both the menus (Image)
	   and the Preferencess->Cache.  Turning it on loads the 
	   image sequences in the background but it makes the GUI
	   slow.  Thus, the default is off.

v2.9.1   - Made selection of Favorite follow preferences of a single 
	   click to make it consistent with the travelling of folders.
	 - Made context sensitive menus in file requester respect
	   the user's locale settings.
	 - Fixed a hanging bug when selecting favorites from the pull
	   down or when changing file type from the other pull down.

v2.9.0   - Moved compilation to use ninja build system on both platforms.
	 - Fixed some documentation in Spanish and added some more info on
	   the English docs.
	 - Bug fixed changing FPS in the Preferences and hitting okay will
	   no longer change FPS.  FPS set in Preferences is for starting
	   the viewer.
	 - Bug fixed loops starting at other frame than 1.  Previously,
	   the looping would happen twice the frame set.  So if you had
	   set the loop at frame 30, the loop would happen at frame 60.
	 - Bug fixed gaps in cache when looping small videos.
	 - Made the file requester much nicers and multithreaded to 
	   load previews of movies, sequences and images.

v2.8.9   - Made printout of ACES file loaded always display full path to it.
	 - Added Open/Save menus to Image Browser (Reel List).
	 - Improved performance of drawing green cache line.
	 - Bug fixed a hanging bug which would happen when looping from
	   the last frame of a video.
	 - Made Clear Cache work on videos, too.
	 - Made .webm a valid video extension.
	 - Made shaders unpremult-gamma-premult to avoid edge
	   fringing in compositing gamma 2.2 images (OpenEXR).  
	   This option is turned on by using a different video 
	   blend mode as set in the preferences. 
	 - Added documentation in Spanish.

v2.8.8   - Fixed some crashing and hanging bugs when playing
	   backwards or scrubbing backwards.
	 - Fixed loading of image magick formats on Linux.
	 - Further refinement of reverse playback to make it faster.

v2.8.7   - Made cache a trailing cache when playing forwards, to
	   easily allow for scrubbing.
	 - Made cache a two way cache when scrubbing.
	 - Allowed user to set cache size in Preferences.  The current
	   range is 30 to 200 frames or FPS (twice the FPS).  Note
	   that the requester can be overshot to store even more frames.
	 - Fixed audio trashing memory sometimes, which could lead
	   to a crash.

v2.8.6   - Bug fix of audio caches being unlimited.
	 - Bug fix of reverse playback with audio disappearing.
	 - Further refinement of caches when scrubbing for smoother
	   playback.
	 - Audio offset works with positive values (ie. audio shifted
	   before video ).  Movies and sequences of frames can be
	   saved with added audio shifted.
	 - Added command-line flag (o) to shift audio.

v2.8.5   - Quick bug fix release to remove the bug of playback going
	   too fast due to not syncing with audio on some movie files.

v2.8.4   - Bug fixed audio playback with offsets.
	 - Made scrubbing more fluid due to an expanded cache and some
	   speed optimizations.
	 - Added In (i) and Out (o) hotkeys to quickly set the in and
	   out points of the video(s) being played. 

v2.8.3   - Bug fixed FPS change to prevent FPS of 0 or less.
	 - Bug fixed playback of image sequences not showing the
	   last frame sometimes.
	 - Bug fixed crash in wmv movie files with wmav2 audio.
	 - Sped up saving of GL Snapshots a tad.
	 - Bug fixed audio offset to not play beyond timeline.
	 - Bug fixed playback of audio with audio offsets in seek.
	 - Improved performance of seeks since audio was played
	   twice.
	 - Bug fixed wrong shortcuts in DEB and RPM builds.

v2.8.2   - Removed incorrect error when buffers were full.
	 - Added routine to print out decode status in natural
	   language instead of a code.
	 - Allowed saving of opengl snapshot to movie files.  This
	   works identically to saving normal movies, but requires user
	   to Save explicitally with the GL Snapshots option.
	 - Bug fixed opengl snapshot saving to save the view without
	   any additional green headroom.
	 - Bug fixed opengl snapshots saving being one frame behind.
	 - Bug fixed a crash when saving movies whose first 
	   audio frame was 0.

v2.8.1   - Improved playback of movies sometimes when pts was skipping
	   a frame.
	 - Minor speeding up in movie playback.
	 - Bug fixed playback of image sequences with attached sound,
	   which would freeze on a frame.
	 - Added the option to offset the attached audio file so as to
	   sync the audio without cutting the original clip.
	 - Documented RMB menu options.
	 - Turned off PostgreSQL database driver on Linux by default 
	   so as to avoid errors on startup for new users.
	 - Fixed crash on wrong locale.  Now it exits gracefully.

v2.8.0   - Bug fixed playback in reverse to not use so much memory.
	 - Retrofit previous algorithm for movie playback as new 
	   algorithm was not frame accurate.
	 - Bug fixed playback of one sample movie (PoTC.VOB), which
	   would start with frame frozen.
	 - Bug fixed movies that had B frames in it and would show 
	   incorrectly.

v2.7.9   - Bug fixed start frame on BG image, which would offset by 1 
	   frame.
	 - Added display of FG and BG images to title bar.  Previously,
	   this would only be used when edl was on.
	 - Improved performance of seek in video playback and scrubbing.
	 - Improved performance of reverse playback.
	 - Reverse playback is now frame accurate, instead of being
	   shifted by one frame.

v2.7.8   - Fixed hangs and crashes on playback of single images in EDL.
	 - Fixed file requester not showing negative frames correctly.
	 - Fixed file association for jpg, png, tiff, and others on Linux 
	   installers.
	 - Fixed ImageMagick saving.  Gamma is baked in instead of passed
	   to image attribute.
	 - Made ImageMagick loader load all images as gamma 1.0, 
	   regardless, as it incorrectly tags images as gamma 0.4545.
	 - Fixed Clone Image crash due to wrong path check.
	 - Fixed Clone Image not cloning CTL's IDT transform.
	 - Internal images like SMPTE color bars don't start with a RRT.
	 - When saving, if LUT is active, ACES Metadata saving is turned 
	   on. If LUT is not active, ACES Metadata is turned off.

v2.7.7   - Clamped values of ITU 709 as it could result in overflows and
	   saturated colors.
	 - Windows64 version of mrViewer was distributed with 16bits
	   ImageMagick instead of 32 bits HDRI.
	 - Added sun raster images to mime types under Linux.
	 - Bug fixed streams' duration to not be always 200 seconds, but
	   the real duration.
	 - Streams duration are shown as frames, seconds and time instead
	   of seconds and time only.
	 - Bug fixed openexr loader with lumma as it was trashing memory
	   and possibly hanging the viewer. This also makes the loader a tad
	   faster.
	 - Made R,G,B,A,L,Z hotkeys default to main channels only.
	   Previously they would randomly change depending on what
	   channel was selected.
	 - Made LUT not include image in lut path, so multiple images
	   can share the same lut.  This makes it calculate less luts per
	   invocation.

v2.7.6   - Fixed LUT comparison of two images.  Previously, LUT could turn
	   off without any warning when switching images.
	 - Fixed fit image when image was flipped and not stereo.
	 - Fixed creation of thumbnails of movies created with ITU 601 
	   colors.
	 - Fixed color queries of movies created with ITU 601 colors.
	 - Improved accuracy of 3d lookup color evaluation in pixel queries.
	 - Made minor adjustments to color bar interface, moving the Pixel
	   Values widget.

v2.7.5   - Saving out a GradeRef that was turned into LMTs now works
	   properly.  This allows loading and saving an ACES clip file 
	   without corrupting the transforms.
	 - Fixed a bug that would remove the last LMT if you chose
	   cancel on the last empty LMT.
	 - Fixed a memory corruption if LMT's Choose requester was chosen
	   twice.
	 - Fixed the defaults gamma, gain and mask float values in the Spanish
	   locale (changing the dot for a comma).
	 - Bug fixed starting up with LUT active (Set in Preferences). 
	   Previously, it would crash the program.
	 - Bug fixed playback of real media clip that had more than
	   100 frames of audio at the beginning.
	 - Fixed a crash that would happen if you selected FPS Default
	   when no image was loaded.
	 - Fixed locale problems on Windows, where double and float
	   conversions were not handled well.

v2.7.4   - Bug fixed a crashing bug in Windows 32 when displaying the
	   image information window.
	 - Added support for GradeRef in ACES.  This is done thru a list
	   of LMTs.
	 - Parsing of ACESclip .xml file is now more correct and will
	   output more information when it fails loading it. 
	 - Preference window would not show the CTL_MODULE_PATH variable
	   under the Spanish locale.
	 - Made ACEScsc ctl scripts appear when listing LMTs.
	 - Removed silly error of not finding the ACESclip file for files
	   that don't have matching ACESclip files.

v2.7.3   - Made LUT pixel and color area lookups a tad faster.
	 - Added an option in the pixel bar's RGBA toolbar to switch to
	   display pixels as:
	   * Full (show pixel values with gamma, gain and lut if on),
	   * Gamma (show pixel values with gamma and gain only)
	   * Original (show pixel values unchanged by gain, gamma or lut)
	 - Made color area window, histogram and vectorscope react 
	   automatically to changes in gamma, gain or lut.  This makes
	   all tools more interactive and more useful.
	 - All color tools (pixel values, color area info, vectorscope
	   and histogram) respect the pixel values setting in the main
	   pixel toolbar.
	 - Upgraded ImageMagick to a newer, 32 bits float HDRI version.
	 - Updated all small popup menus to not draw the glyph for
	   readability issues.
	 - Bug fixed a crashing bug on Windows when Add to Favorites
	   was pushed.  This bug is due to a broken libintl on windows.
	 - Bug fixed a similar crash on Windows when saving a reel.
	 - More translated messages into Spanish.

v2.7.2   - Bug fixed a warning in running CTL with ICC preferred.
	 - Added ACES utilities to distribution: ctlrender, exr_dpx_exr and
	   exrdpx.
	 - Made color picker with LUT work in real time.
	 - Removed the preference switch to show colors in pixel toolbar.
	 - Added showing color of LUT in Color Area Information Window.
	 - Bug fixed a startup bug when setlocale failed.

v2.7.1   - With NSIS exe installer, made Windows' icons show the version 
	   number.
	 - Bug fixed CTL Look Modulation Transform Picker.
	 - Bug fixed libACESclip to use linkTransform instead of name
	   when available. Made reader/writer use TransformID instead of name.
	 - Bug fixed RPM installer not creating ln -s /usr/bin/mrViewer
	   correctly.
	 - Color picker now can show colors with the LUT applied.  This 
	   makes the gui (zoom) respond a tad slower when the LUT is on.
	   As such a preferences option was added.
	 - Added switch in Preferences to show pixel color values after LUT.
	 - Made DEB/RPM installer on Linux place an icon in desktop in
	   any language locale.
	 - DEB/RPM will register file associations (mime-types) to all of
	   mrViewer's recognized files.
	 - Added translation to Spanish when that's the locale default.
	 - Updated libACESclip to new format according to Jim Houston.

v2.7.0   - Added ACEScsc files as IDTs to support DigitalLAD sample picture.
	 - Made xml and ctl files never show as sequences of frames in
	   file requester.
	 - On Linux, now mrViewer is added to the system path thru a symlink.
	 - On Linux, mrViewer is added to the menus (Graphic) if run from the
	   deb or rpm file.
	 - Added Mirror Horizontal and Vertical to Image RMB popup menu.
	 - Added baking CTL/ICC transforms to a 96x96x96 grid.
	 - Removed Load button from CTL requester as it was not working right.
	 - Resolved a quoting issue in mrViewer.sh to work with parameters
	   with spaces.
	 - Bug fixed parsing of hotkeys when some ctrl, alt or meta keys were
	   combined.
	 - Bug fixed CTL pipeline when CTL file is not found.
	 - CTL's IDT, RRT, ODT keywords are allowed anywhere in the
	   filename, not only as prefixes.
	 - Made saving of ACESclip XML file automatically fill up the name in
	   file requester.
	 - NSIS installer: Win64 and Win32 create different icons 
	   (mrViewer-64 and mrViewer-32 respectively).

v2.6.9   - Bug fixed Cancel button in CTL requester.
	 - Added a Load button to CTL requester to load CTL scripts not in
	   CTL_MODULE_PATH.
	 - Added support for CTL Input Device Transforms (IDTs).
	 - Added support for CTL Look Mod Transforms (LMTs).
	 - Added support to ACES 1.0 Clip Metadata to store all transforms
	   in an XML file.

v2.6.8   - Bug fixed lut creation on 32 and 128 sizes.  Previously, they would
	   get created and not cached.
	 - Adapted CTL pipeline to be compatible with ACES 1.0.  The one
	   rendering transform and all output device transforms from ACES
	   can be used.
	   Note that the previous transform_RRT and ODT_monitor have been
	   deprecated as they operate on XYZ.

v2.6.7   - Added installers for both platforms. The main benefit is
	   for Windows where shortcuts and an icon in Desktop are created.

v2.6.6.3 - Bug fixed pixel info display when mirror X or mirror Y are
           in effect.
         - Bug fixed color info, histogram and vectorscope when mirror
           X or Y are in effect.
         - Bug fixed data window display when mirror X or Y are in
           effect.
         - Bug fixed mirror X and mirror Y in stereo displays.

v2.6.6.2 - Bug fixed center and fit image when pixel ratio was different
	   than 1.
	 - Bug fixed mirror X and mirror Y when different data/display 
	   window is present.  Previously, the flipping was done within
	   the data window.
	 - Added back again the S and E buttons in the timeline to set
	   the start and ending of clips or the timeline.  The E button
	   works well, but the S button is subject to movies caches.
	 - Use ffmpeg's png loader when cache is off.  The loader is really
	   fast but requires opening of the file with the avi (ffmpeg) loader.
	   That means you cannot load the png sequence and then switch to the 
	   non-cache loader without reloading the sequence.

v2.6.6.1 - Reworked the Cache Preferences to allow:
	   * Not using any cache for streaming images directly from disk.
	     The performance of this is extremely dependant on the images being
	     loaded.
	   * 8 bit caches to save RAM at the expense of baking the gamma in.
	   * Scale to proxy images (one half, one quarter or one eighth of the
	     original size) also to save RAM.

v2.6.5.6 - Made caching work on all sequences in reels and timeline in EDL.
	   Progress goes from one sequence to the next.
	 - Removed reloading of movie files when they change in disk.
	   Previously the whole reel would get corrupted.
	 - Replaced zlib1.dll in win32 distribution as it was corrupt and
	   would cause crashes when loading some exr images.

v2.6.5.5 - Added a green bar display for frame caches in the timeline for 
	   both movies and sequences.
	 - Bug fixed a hanging problem when exiting while playing backwards
	   movie with audio.
	 - Bug fixed a cache problem not caching the first frame when playing 
	   backwards.
	 - Changed Release folder to mrViewer-v$VERSION folder.

v2.6.5.4 - Bug fixed some problems with loop playback of movie files in EDL.  
	   Still not perfect.  There are still sync problems after 
	   several loops specially with ping-pong (swing)
	   playback.
	 - Bug fixed a hanging of the playback when showing individual images
	   all in an EDL edit.
	 - Bug fixed F11 fullscreen not centering the image on Windows.
	 - Made fullscreen presentation (F12) support covering the taskbar on
	   Windows.
	 - Made fullscreen and presentation modes be passed across the network.

v2.6.5.3 - Made preloading of sequences being shown while idle.
	 - Fixed a crash of Cut tool in EDL when the cut happened in inactive
	   reel.
	 - Troubleshoot playback of EDL movies in background.
	 - Added a BG button to EDL Edit window to more easily set the
	   background image.

v2.6.5.2 - Upgraded to latest ffmpeg, libx264.
	 - Fixed swing looping in short movie files which could hang the 
	   viewer.
	 - Made play backwards faster due to increase in seek speed.
	 - Fixed wrong calculation of frame differences in backwards playback.

v2.6.5.1 - Fixed subtitles displaying in black only.
	 - Made grease pencil a property of the image instead of the viewer.
	 - Grease pencil drawings are saved and loaded to/from a reel.
	 - Grease pencil drawings are synced over TCP/IP on connection.
	 - GL Snapshot now can save a sequence of frames.
	 - Added The Color Transformation Language manual ( CtlManual.pdf )
	   to the docs folder.
	 - Made exr loader a tiny bit faster when it is a multiview image.
	 - Bug fixed a minor memory leak when quitting in color channel string.
	 - EDL timeline now supports play and step hotkeys.
	 - Fixed EXR loader not loading exif attributes.
	 - Fixed EXR saver to save all known attributes of image, except tiling.
	 - Added a Cut tool to EDL Window.  Allows cutting of clips, to later
	   delete them or move them somewhere else.
	 - Added Merge tool to undo the Cut tool.
	 - Fixed name of zlib1.dll in windows32 distributions.

v2.6.5.0 - Simplified and sped up exr loader.
	 - Fixed crash of exr loader when working with an image with a single
	   view.
	 - Added 3D View to evaluate deep scanline and deep tile image.
	 - EXR loader now supports deep tile images. 
	 - Bug fixed ILM format of image sequences ( beauty.1-24.exr )

v2.6.4.4 - Sped up reading of image files (specially the first of a sequence).
	 - Bug fixed OpenEXR stereo crossed not respecting dataWindows 
	   correctly.
	 - Bug fixed Single Instance to load images that are fed thru another
	   instance of viewer.

v2.6.4.3 - Updated all platforms to OpenEXR 2.2.

	 - Added missing rails directory to win64 release.
	 - Added HISTORY.txt and Videos.txt to win64 release.
	 - Added docs to win64 release.
	 - Restored glDrawPixels opengl drawing albeit buggy but needed for
	   old gfx cards.
	 - Updated version from v2.6.4.0.

v2.6.4.1 - Made autofit work in EDL timeline when switching images.
	 - Fixed loading of a single image which would always load all images
	   in a sequence.
	 - Fixed BG image and wipe mode in network connections.
	 - Bug fixed color area window selection in stereo and added a square
	   displaying the mean color in the color info window.
	 - Updated to OpenEXR 2.2 on Linux.  Windows is stuck with 2.1.
	 - Updated -h (help) command-line on windows to pop up a console with
	   instructions.

v2.6.4.0 - Added a starting audio volume preference to the default 
	   audio preferences.
	 - Made preferences run when the user hits ok.  Previously ok did
	   nothing.  This allows testing preferences much easier.
	 - Pixel Info is now available for background images even when those
	   background images have a different size than the foreground one.
	   Note that Color Info Selection shows only the foreground image 
	   values.
	 - Bug fixed file requester when clicking with rmb on a folder 
	   which would access the folder instead of the menus.
