	   when available. Made reader/writer use TransformID instead of name.
	 - Bug fixed RPM installer not creating ln -s /usr/bin/mrViewer
	   correctly.
	 - Color picker now can show colors with the LUT applied.  This 
	   makes the gui (zoom) respond a tad slower when the LUT is on.
	   As such a preferences option was added.
	 - Added switch in Preferences to show pixel color values after LUT.
	 - Made DEB/RPM installer on Linux place an icon in desktop in
	   any language locale.
	 - DEB/RPM will register file associations (mime-types) to all of
	   mrViewer's recognized files.
	 - Added translation to Spanish when that's the locale default.
	 - Updated libACESclip to new format according to Jim Houston.

v2.7.0   - Added ACEScsc files as IDTs to support DigitalLAD sample picture.
	 - Made xml and ctl files never show as sequences of frames in
	   file requester.
	 - On Linux, now mrViewer is added to the system path thru a symlink.
	 - On Linux, mrViewer is added to the menus (Graphic) if run from the
	   deb or rpm file.
	 - Added Mirror Horizontal and Vertical to Image RMB popup menu.
	 - Added baking CTL/ICC transforms to a 96x96x96 grid.
	 - Removed Load button from CTL requester as it was not working right.
	 - Resolved a quoting issue in mrViewer.sh to work with parameters
	   with spaces.
	 - Bug fixed parsing of hotkeys when some ctrl, alt or meta keys were
	   combined.
	 - Bug fixed CTL pipeline when CTL file is not found.
	 - CTL's IDT, RRT, ODT keywords are allowed anywhere in the
	   filename, not only as prefixes.
	 - Made saving of ACESclip XML file automatically fill up the name in
	   file requester.
	 - NSIS installer: Win64 and Win32 create different icons 
	   (mrViewer-64 and mrViewer-32 respectively).

v2.6.9   - Bug fixed Cancel button in CTL requester.
	 - Added a Load button to CTL requester to load CTL scripts not in
	   CTL_MODULE_PATH.
	 - Added support for CTL Input Device Transforms (IDTs).
	 - Added support for CTL Look Mod Transforms (LMTs).
	 - Added support to ACES 1.0 Clip Metadata to store all transforms
	   in an XML file.

v2.6.8   - Bug fixed lut creation on 32 and 128 sizes.  Previously, they would
	   get created and not cached.
	 - Adapted CTL pipeline to be compatible with ACES 1.0.  The one
	   rendering transform and all output device transforms from ACES
	   can be used.
	   Note that the previous transform_RRT and ODT_monitor have been
	   deprecated as they operate on XYZ.

v2.6.7   - Added installers for both platforms. The main benefit is
	   for Windows where shortcuts and an icon in Desktop are created.

v2.6.6.3 - Bug fixed pixel info display when mirror X or mirror Y are
           in effect.
         - Bug fixed color info, histogram and vectorscope when mirror
           X or Y are in effect.

v2.6.6.2 - Bug fixed center and fit image when pixel ratio was different
	   than 1.
	 - Bug fixed mirror X and mirror Y when different data/display 
	   window is present.  Previously, the flipping was done within
	   the data window.
	 - Added back again the S and E buttons in the timeline to set
	   the start and ending of clips or the timeline.  The E button
	   works well, but the S button is subject to movies caches.
	 - Use ffmpeg's png loader when cache is off.  The loader is really
	   fast but requires opening of the file with the avi (ffmpeg) loader.
	   That means you cannot load the png sequence and then switch to the 
	   non-cache loader without reloading the sequence.

v2.6.6.1 - Reworked the Cache Preferences to allow:
	   * Not using any cache for streaming images directly from disk.
	     The performance of this is extremely dependant on the images being
	     loaded.
	   * 8 bit caches to save RAM at the expense of baking the gamma in.
	   * Scale to proxy images (one half, one quarter or one eighth of the
	     original size) also to save RAM.

v2.6.5.6 - Made caching work on all sequences in reels and timeline in EDL.
	   Progress goes from one sequence to the next.
	 - Removed reloading of movie files when they change in disk.
	   Previously the whole reel would get corrupted.
	 - Replaced zlib1.dll in win32 distribution as it was corrupt and
	   would cause crashes when loading some exr images.

	   both movies and sequences.
	 - Bug fixed a hanging problem when exiting while playing backwards
	   movie with audio.

	   backwards.
	 - Changed Release folder to mrViewer-v$VERSION folder.

v2.6.5.4 - Bug fixed some problems with loop playback of movie files in EDL.  
	   Still not perfect.  There are still sync problems after 
	   several loops specially with ping-pong (swing)
	   playback.
	 - Bug fixed a hanging of the playback when showing individual images
	   all in an EDL edit.
	 - Bug fixed F11 fullscreen not centering the image on Windows.

	 - EDL timeline now supports play and step hotkeys.
	 - Fixed EXR loader not loading exif attributes.
	 - Fixed EXR saver to save all known attributes of image, except tiling.
	 - Added a Cut tool to EDL Window.  Allows cutting of clips, to later
	   delete them or move them somewhere else.
	 - Added Merge tool to undo the Cut tool.
	 - Fixed name of zlib1.dll in windows32 distributions.

v2.6.5.0 - Simplified and sped up exr loader.

	 - Updated -h (help) command-line on windows to pop up a console with
	   instructions.

v2.6.4.0 - Added a starting audio volume preference to the default 
	   audio preferences.
	 - Made preferences run when the user hits ok.  Previously ok did
	   nothing.  This allows testing preferences much easier.
	 - Pixel Info is now available for background images even when those
	   background images have a different size than the foreground one.
	   Note that Color Info Selection shows only the foreground image 
	   values.

	   In the case of Windows, the path is %HOME%, or %USERPROFILE%, or
	   %HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH% searched in that order.
	 - Bug fixed drag and drop not centering the image loaded when
	   auto refit image was off.

	   the data window effects the positioning of the display window.
	 - Adapted fit image function to handle moving data window.
	 - Adapted color info for moving data window.
	 - Added partial support for animated GIFs. As GIFs don't store
	   the length of the animation, a length of 100 frames is used as
	   default.
	 - Adapted draw routines to draw in data window.
	 - Adapted masking routines to draw in data window.
	 - Fixed a bug that would cause a crash when the image information
	   window would get opened for a multipart OpenEXR image.

	   searching is more solid.
	 - Made audio saving a non-default option due to the bugs that still
	   plague it.
v2.5.9.1 - Switching images no longer auto refits them in view when autorefit
	   is on.  It keeps zoom level and offset so as to compare two images 
	   at closeup. Only when window is resized or the image is loaded,
	   autofit takes over.
	 - Made Single Instance of viewer an alert when another instance is
	   running.  The alert also tells user where to remove the lock file.
