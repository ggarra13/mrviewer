Compilation is started with 'mk', a bash command which calls cmake in 
the process and later make.  
Compilation goes into BUILD/{os}-{version}/Release/bin

For compiling some non opengl shaders, Cg is required.

To install the viewer for best performancce, both the shaders and ctl 
directories must be present under a single root, like:

Release/
   	bin/
		mrViewer
	ctl/
		transform_RRT.ctl
	shaders/
		rgba.cg
