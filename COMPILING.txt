Compiling mrViewer requires a number of dependencies:

- Ninja build system (optional)
- Boost 1.51 or later
- OpenEXR 2.2.0 or later
- CTL 1.5.1 or later
- OpenEXR_CTL 1.0.1 or later
- FFMPEG git or 2.3 or later
- GLUT
- FLTK 2.0
- ImageMagick 6.7.4 or later
- GLEW 1.11 or later
- TCLAP 1.2.1
- SampleICC 1.6.6 or later
- libiconv
- libintl

The files win32_vars and win64_vars contain definitions for compiling
on the windows platform. They point to the dependencies directory.

The dependencies directory now contains the latest libraries used to
compile mrViewer.

More often than not, there will be a build-linux64 directory, for
example, with a runme.sh shell script for easy compilation.
Same for windows, albeit on windows you will need some bash emulation,
like MSYS/MingW.
Some packages on windows require Visual Studio.  This is true for fltk2,
and ImageMagick.
On Windows, some packages come precompiled, like libiconv, libintl, etc.

To compile under windows, you need the Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.
The Win32 version of mrViewer is compiled with msvc12.0 (Visual Studio 2013).
The x64   version of mrViewer is compiled with msvc14.0 (Visual Studio 2015).
