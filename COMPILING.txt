Under Linux and macOS, the superbuild.sh script will call SuperBuild/runme.sh to compile all non system dependencies and install them in install-$OS-$RELEASE.  Then it will compile and bundle the main directory with the other runme.sh script in that main directory.

The files vc14_win32_vars and vc14_win64_vars contain definitions for compiling
on the windows platform. They point to the dependencies directory.  You will need to modify the directories to point to your own file system.
For ffmpeg, you can build it with WSL or with the m-ab-s/media-autobuild_suite.
You also need libiconv and libintl (gettext) for translations.  You can get them from: https://mlocati.github.io/articles/gettext-iconv-windows.html

To compile under windows, you need the Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition or later.
Both the win32 and x64 version of mrViewer have been compiled with Visual Studio 2019.
