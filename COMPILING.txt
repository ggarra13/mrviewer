Compiling mrViewer requires a number of dependencies:

- Ninja build system (optional)
- Boost 1.69 or later
- OpenEXR 2.3.0 or later
- CTL 1.5.1 or later
- OpenEXR_CTL 1.0.1 or later
- FFMPEG git
- GLUT
- FLTK 1.4 or later
- ImageMagick 6.7.4 or later
- GLEW 1.11 or later
- TCLAP 1.2.1
- SampleICC 1.6.8 or later
- OpenColorIO 1.0

Under Linux, the external directory has a CMakeLists.txt file for downloading and compiling the most difficult extensions that are usually not shipped with the OS.  To compile them, run the runme.sh script.  The libs will get installed in ../install-Linux-$VERSION.  Then the script will request your password to copy the files under /usr/local.

The files vc14_win32_vars and vc14_win64_vars contain definitions for compiling
on the windows platform. They point to the dependencies directory.  You will need to modify the directories to point to your own file system.
For ffmpeg, you can rely on the prebuilt files from https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds.  You will need the shared and developer downloads which you will need to place in a common directory.

To compile under windows, you need the Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition or later.
Both the win32 and x64 version of mrViewer have been compiled with msvc14.0 (Visual Studio 2015).
