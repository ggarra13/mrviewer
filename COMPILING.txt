Compiling mrViewer requires a number of dependencies:

- Ninja build system (optional)
- Boost 1.51 or later
- OpenEXR 2.2.0 or later
- CTL 1.5.1 or later
- OpenEXR_CTL 1.0.1 or later
- FFMPEG git or 2.3 or later
- GLUT
- FLTK 2.0
- ImageMagick 6.7.4 or later
- GLEW 1.11 or later
- TCLAP 1.2.1
- SampleICC 1.6.6 or later
- libintl

The files win32_vars and win64_vars contain definitions for compiling
on the windows platform.

The dependencies directory now contains the latest libraries used to
compile mrViewer.

More often than not, there will be a build-linux64 directory, for
example, with a runme.sh shell script for easy compilation.
Same for windows, albeit on windows you will need some bash emulation,
like MSYS/MingW.
