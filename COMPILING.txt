mrViewer's code is a mess and it has a lot of cruft in it.  I am planning on rewriting it to remove all of its problems, remove code borrowed from other places and other stuff.  If you haven't contributed to mrViewer, now is the time to do so.

To compile mrViewer, you need a number of dependencies installed:

- Ninja (for LibHarfbuzz)
- Ruby (any version older than 1.8)
- FFMPEG's components (on Windows, wiwth m-abs-media script these get compiled
		      for you.  On macOS and Linux you can rely on the packages
		      of your OS like dnf or brew )
	 - libfontconfig
	 - libfreetype
	 - libfribidi
	 - libgnutls
	 - libogg
	 - libvorbis
	 - libvorbisenc
	 - libvpx
	 - libx264 (GPL only)
	 - libx265 (GPL only)
	 - libxml
	 - libwebp
- GLUT
- ImageMagick 6.7.4 or later ( Windows only, Linux and macOS will
			       compile in superbuild )
- GLEW 1.11 or later
- SampleICC 1.6.8 or later
- libiconv
- libintl

Under Linux and macOS, the superbuild.sh script will call SuperBuild/runme.sh to compile all non system dependencies and install them in install-$OS-$RELEASE.  Then it will compile and bundle the main directory with the other runme.sh script in that main directory and place the main bundles in the main directory.  The executable will be placed in the BUILD/$OS-$RELEASE directory.
Under macOS, the Superbuild compilation will currently stop at the end when compiling FLTK, as it will try to install fluid in a system directory.

For compiling just the dependencies (SuperBuild directory) or just the main program, there are runme.sh scripts on each corresponding directory.

Testing the build on Linux or Windows (RUNNING mrViewer without installing):

run the ruby script:

utils/libs.rb

and it will install all dependencies.

The files vc14_win32_vars and vc14_win64_vars contain mingw bash definitions for compiling on the windows platform. They point to the dependencies directories on my machine.  You will need to modify the directories to point to your own file system.

For ffmpeg, you can build it with WSL or with the m-ab-s/media-autobuild_suite
(https://github.com/m-ab-s/media-autobuild_suite/archive/master.zip ).

You also need libiconv and libintl (gettext) for translations.  You can get them from: https://mlocati.github.io/articles/gettext-iconv-windows.html

To compile under windows, you need the Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition (tested) or later (untested).
Both the x86 and x64 version of mrViewer have been compiled with Visual Studio 2019.
