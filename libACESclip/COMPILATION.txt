For compiling, you need to have:

- boost::uuid
- tinyxml2

You can google them for getting the latest.

Compilation is done with cmake.  A shell wrapper utility (mk) is provided
to build out of source and set other settings in cmake.

So, to compile, you'd do:

$ mk

from a shell console.  In Windows, you can use mingw or cygwin, with the paths set up for the Microsoft compiler.
The resulting files will go into BUILD/Platform-version-arch/Release/ in the bin and lib directories.

Running then:

$ sudo ./mk install

will install the library and binaries in the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH (/usr/local).
